II Observations and Experiments on the Structure and Functions of the Sponge. By Robert Edmond Grant.
 As the large fecal orifices on the surface of the sponge were the only entrances to the internal canals which had hitherto attracted the attention of zoologists, it was very natural for them to suppose that the nourishment of this animal is drawn into the body by these apertures, as by so many polypi; and whether they supposed this power of suction to depend on the fecal orifices themselves, or on the contraction and dilatation of the general mass of the sponge, they could not fail to imagine that those orifices would exhibit a kind of systole and diastole corresponding with the exit and entrance of the water. Cavolini, indeed, that profound and accurate observer, had not only seen the minute pores every where over the surface of the animal, but even conceived that the sponge was nourished by these superficial pores, as marine plants are. He was not aware, however, of the currents which pass continually through the body of this animal, and imagined the fecal orifices to be mere accidental appearances, which arc not met with on every sponge. As this circumstance of the want of fecal orifices on many sponges has been frequently alleged by naturalists, and even by Lamouroux, it may be proper to remark here, that, as currents ofwater pass through the body of every living sponge, from the surface towards the interior, the same currents arc continually flowing from the interior to the surface by different passages; and it is of little importance in the economy of this animal, whether the apertures by which the currents have their exit, be large and conspicuous, or minute and less easily observable; every species of this genus must necessarily possess such orifices, great or small, for the discharge of its currents, its excrements, and its ova.
In the Spongia compressa, and many tubular sponges, the currents pass in a perfectly straight line through their parietes, from the external pores to the interior of their general cavity, which is always quite open at its pendent extremity. On laying open such sponges, we do not perceive, either on their internal or external surface, any large fecal orifices as we see on the external surface of the Spongia officinalis; but if we examine the internal surface of their general cavity, we easily perceive that they have nearly as many small orifices for the exit of the currents, as there arc pores on the outer surface of their parietes for their admission. It is quite evident, that, in such sponges as the papillaris, cristata, panicea, &c. the same arrangement could not possibly exist; for, as these animals spread over the smooth surface of cliffs, the currents cannot possibly find an exit on the surface opposite to that on which the pores are distributed, that surface of the sponge being completely shut up by the solid rock. They are doomed to have but one free surface for the distribution both of their pores and fecal orifices; and, therefore, the pores, and the narrow tubes leading in from them, must cither pass on separately through the body, and open again, each by a distinct orifice on the surface, or they must pour their currents into certain general reservoirs or canals, ramified through every part of the body, which may convey them away by few and large orifices. In the former case, there would be as many fecal orifices pouring their foul contents over the downy surface of the animal, as there are pores whose delicate inhabitants are struggling to convey a limpid stream through the interior. In the latter case, which is the arrangement followed by nature in the construction of this beautiful and complicated zoophyte, a much greater surface is allowed for the distribution of the pores, and much greater cleanliness is observed in discharging the feculent matter, by a few orifices, and those placed at a convenient distance from the pores. The branched sponges, as the oculata, dlcJiotoma, &c. are, in this particular, placed nearly in the same circumstances as those which spread over the surface of rocks: they have but one surface for the distribution of their pores and fecal orifices, and, consequently, we observe them collect their currents, and bring them back to the surface, by few and large orifices, which are conveniently arranged along the outer margins of the branches. Every sponge, therefore, possesses fecal orifices, though differing remarkably in size and distribution in the different species; and though the following observations and experiments have been made chiefly on those orifices which are large and conspicuous, and have already been observed by naturalists, it is evident that they must apply equally to those which have escaped observation from their minuteness.
Since Marsigli first stated, more than a century ago, that he had actually seen these round fecal orifices on the surface contract and dilate themselves in the sponges of the Mediterranean, Ellis and Dr Knight have declared the same fact respecting the sponges of the English coast, and the same statement has been repeated by other naturalists. Solander, Ellis, Gmelin, liruguiere, and Bosc, have introduced the singular power of suction ascribed to the fecal orifices into their definitions of the sponge. Lamouroux and Lamarck consider these orifices as destined to admit water into the interior of the body, or as common orifices through which polypi occasionally shoot out their heads. Pallas has introduced the systole and diastole, ascribed to these orifices by his predecessors, into his definition of this animal, and Cuvier has copied this singular phenomenon of the living sponge, as an established fact, into his Regno Animal.
In a subject like this, which has defied the researches of naturalists for a period of three thousand years, it is an important step towards the discovery of truth, to examine minutely the accuracy of all statements and opinions already entertained regarding it, whether supported by great authorities or by great antiquity. It is of some importance to determine, Whether the living sponge has any such power of contracting and dilating the fecal orifices; because such a property might have much influence in the mysterious functions of this animal; or a belief in its existence might lead to an erroneous opinion of the uses of these orifices, or might interfere with the true explanation of the currents which flow from them. It is likewise important to inquire into the existence of this property, because we have just seen that it has been assumed by the most eminent naturalists as a leading character of discrimination between the sponge and nearly allied genera of zoophytes.
It has been already shewn, by the above experiments, relative to the direction and force of the streams, that the currents never flow into the fecal orifices, but constantly, in one direction, from them, with a smooth and equable motion. It must therefore be evident, that any palpitation, or other motion, which the bps of these apertures might exhibit, could have no effect in producing the streams which flow from them, whatever function such singular motions might perform, in the economy of the sponge. I must likewise observe, that those naturalists who asserted, that they had seen this systole and diastole, or palpitation of the fecal orifices, at the same time believed, that these motions had the most intimate connection with the streams; that the sponge, in fact, sucked in and squirted out water by these orifices, as by so many polypi; or, as we see Ascidie, and many bivalve mollusca, suck in and squirt out water by two highly contractile orifices. There is, therefore, some grounds for suspecting, that their preconceived errors may have had some influence on their observation of the fact; and as Mr Ellis has been proved above to be wrong in the most material part of his statement, regarding the direction of the currents; he may likewise have fallen into sortie mistake, in what he has alleged concerning the motions of
I first selected a large entire specimen of the Spongia panteta from a basin of sea-water, in which I perceived it propelling its feculent matter very briskly, and, along with that matter, occasionally discharging those singular moving round bodies, which I have termed above the Ova of the Sponge, in with the nomenclature of naturalists, for similar have proved to be the germs of other zoophytes. As this sponge has always few and very large fecal orifices lying on a level with the general surface of the animal, it is well calculated for examining the singular properties of suction, palpitation, systole and diastole, which have been so generally ascribed to these orifices. Having placed this lively specimen in a shallow vessel, filled with clear sea-water, and in a favourable light, for looking down into its aperture, I observed it attentively, for a quarter of an hour, with the naked eye; and afterwards, for nearly the same length of time, through a pocket lens, but could not detect the slightest contraction or palpitation, nor the most languid motion of the orifice, over which the lens rested, although the stream continued to flow quickly from it, without interruption, during the whole lime. I now let fall a dark coloured grain of basalt into the orifice of this bright yellow sponge, and looked sideways upon it, in such a position, that die grain was only half seen over the margin of the aperture; the slightest dilatation would have brought the whole of the grain into view, and the slightest contraction would have it from me; but though attentively observed for ten minutes, with the head fixed in one position, the grain remained constantly in the same situation, just half seen, over the margin of the orifice. In another living specimen of the same kind of sponge, I tried to force the aperture to contract, by piercing and irritating its parietes with a sharp needle; and after pouring off a little of the sea-water, I touched the vicinity of the aperture with a red-hot wire, without producing in the dimensions of the orifice. In all the experiments of this kind, I have never been able, by any irritation of a fecal orifice, to accelerate or retard, in the slightest degree, the velocity of the current, which issues from it.
I have frequently reclined upon the rocks, both at Prestonpans Bay and at Leith, during the recess of the tide, and have watched attentively, with the naked eye, and with the assistance of magnifying powers, the fecal orifices of a great variety of sponges, while still growing, uninjured, on their native seats; but neither in those which were under the surface of the sea, nor in those which paved the Ixrttom of limpid pools, nor in those which the tide had left uncovered, could I ever detect the slightest motion of the fecal orifices. In these situations I have irritated and punctured the vicinity of the orifices with a needle, and have touched them with nitric and muriatic acids, and they have, notwithstanding, remained perfectly motionless.
The fecal orifices of the branched species seem to be equally inactive, as in the BC which spread over the surface of rocks. I suspended several living branches of the common Spongia dichotoma, and of the Spongia oculata, and SjMngia xerampclina, separately, in glasses of clear sea-water, and observed attentively, through the sides of the vessels, the round orifices, ranged along the outer margins of the branches, but could not perceive them change their dimensions, in the smallest degree, although their currents and feculent discharges were distinctly seen. On piercing the woolly surface of these branched sponges with a needle in the neighbourhood of the orifices, they did not enlarge or diminish their diameters; a whitish chalky matter came out from the punctured places of these sponges, and diffused itself quickly through the water.
I cut off an entire prominent papilla from the Spongia urens; and after placing it in a watch-glass, with clear sea-water, I looked down, through the straight orifice of this isolated papilla, with a powerful microscope; but though particles of matter were distinctly seen, propelled upwards from the aperture, it was not perceived to change its caliber, or exhibit the slightest motion of any kind. This papilla, with a wide passage extending directly through its axis, when placed on its side, under the microscope, shewed a current passing out at both its open extremities. I may hero remark, that on all papillae which I have hitherto examined, pores, for the lodgement of certain small moving powers, and for the admission of water into the interior, are as distinctly seen as on the general surface of the sponge. I have frequently cut off all the papillae from the surface of a > living sponge, without thereby occasioning the slightest interruption or retardation of the currents from that sponge. And currents have always continued to flow as quickly, and for as long a period, from orifices, deprived of their projecting conical papillae, as from the orifices, on which the papillae had been left entire. I have often taken specimens of the Spongia compressa, which had only one opening at the extremity; and on cutting off their peduncle, so as to lay them open at both ends, I have always found, on placing them under the microscope, with seawater, that they sent forth a current, equally powerful, from the artificial, as from the natural orifice; and, indeed, a transverse section, taken out from the middle of this animal, by cutting off both its ends, when placed under the microscope, is seen to pour forth a languid stream, from both extremities. These circumstances sufficiently shew, that there is nothing in the structure or properties of these orifices, that is at all necessary to the existence of the currents which issue from them; and the only effects which a papilla can possibly have on the current from it, are to convey that current a little off from the general surface of the animal, and to add a little more water to the stream, by the minute currents of the pores, distributed every where over the surface of the papilla itself.
As the Spongia criitata, or CockVcomb Sponge, was the species concerning which Mr Ellis and Dr Knight stated, in the Transactions of the Royal Society of London for 1765, that they had seen the fecal orifices contract and dilate themselves when they examined it alive in a glass of sea-water on the coast of Sussex, I have examined with particular care the phenomena exhibited by this animal in the living state. Neither on the sides of the boulders, where it is met with at Lei in and Frestonpans Bay, nor when favourably placed in a vessel of sea-water, have X ever observed it contract or dilate its orifices. I have frequently examined its apertures with the microscope, both while they were left uncovered, and when they were still carrying on their currents under water, but they have always remained quite motionless. I have tried to excite its orifices to contract, by irritating them with sharp instruments, by letting fall drops of corrosive acids in their immediate vicinity, and by touching the apertures themselves with a red-hot wire, but always without success.
In order to ascertain whether there might be any systole and diastole, or other motions, taking place within the orifices, in the course of the great canals, I observed steadily, through a pockeulens, a globule of air, which I had caused for that purpose to appear at one of the orifices of the Spongia crisiata. Such globules make their appearance at the orifices of a living sponge, when it has been lifted out of the water for a short time, and is again plunged into it, when its canals are partially emptied. The globules of air thus included in the canals by the surrounding water, generally advance with a slow progress to the margins of the orifices, being pushed on by the advancing currents behind, and escape to the surface of the water, to allow a free passage to the stream. It must be obvious, that, if there were any systole and diastole of the lips of the orifices, or any contractions and dilatations of the parietes within the canals, or any such motions of the general mass of the animal, they would have been manifested by the successive advancing and retreating of the globule of air at the orifice of the canal. It did not retreat, however, nor palpitate in the slightest degree, but constantly advanced with a slow and equable motion, till it escaped from the aperture to the surface of the water. I raised this portion of sponge a little out of the water, and placed a single globule of mercury over one of the orifices. While I observed the globule steadily through a magnifying glass, I irritated 'the papilla with a red-hot wire, but did not produce any motion of the orifice or papilla, for the mercury was not observed to rise or sink. A small lively branch of the Spong'ia coalita was placed in a watch-glass, with some sea-water under the greatest magnifier of the double-reflecting microscope. The spicula projecting and converging around the orifice to defend it, were magnified into large, transparent, pointed crystals, and the current from the circular orifice looked like an eruption from the crater of a volcano; but though attentively watched for a quarter of an hour, while the torrent was in full activity, the spicula projecting from the margins of the orifice never moved.
From these experiments, performed with every precaution, and frequently repeated during many months' study of zoophytes upon the coast, I am persuaded that the sponges of the Frith of Forth above enumerated do not exhibit naturally a systole and diastole, or palpitation of the fecal orifices, nor can be forced to exhibit these motions by very powerful irritation. This is a sufficient reason for abandoning such a property as a general character of this immense genus of animals, even though species should hereafter be discovered in tropical seas, which actually exhibit such extraordinary and useless motions; and these experiments likewise serve to shew, that there is no necessary connection between such motions and the currents, or other function of this mysterious being. From the close resemblance in horny fibrous structure, which I observe in the dried sponges of distant seas, which I have been allowed to examine by the liberality of Professor Jameson, and from the outward form and appearance of those which I have seen growing on the shores of Italy and France, I am convinced that it is a property as little by them as by the sponges of the Frith of Forth, indeed, both irritated and punctured, with sharp instruments, the surface of the large Spotigia of ina&s, while still in its native cliffs in the Gulf of Naples, and still under the surface of the sea, without producing the slightest change in the dimensions of its apertures; and though his observations were I forty years ago, we find this singular property ascribed sponge by the naturalists of the present day. When we look on the surface of a living sponge, and observe papillae projecting from the body, and all terminated by circular openings of different dimensions, from which currents of water are constantly pouring out, it is difficult to lade ourselves that each orifice has a fixed diameter; we expect them to contract occasionally, as we are accustomed to see done by the similar openings of many molluscous animals, and the motions caused by the sponge in the mass of the water may somewhat confuse the vision, and thus assist the imagination. When a globule of air is advancing through an orifice under water, it has the effect of diminishing very much the apparent diameter of that orifice, from the great rarity of the air in the globule, compared with the dense medium of the water; and when the globule escapes from the aperture to the surface of the water, the orifice appears to the eye to have enlarged its diameter considerably. I am inclined to think that some optical deception of this kind, a little assisted by the imagination, may have given rise to the belief of a systole and diastole of the fecal orifices.
The opinion entertained by some naturalists, at an unknown period before Aristotle, that the sponge contracts itself when touched, has passed with little change, or examination, through a long lapse of ages, and is copied into the systems of Lamarck and Cuvier. From the remote origin of this opinion among the Greeks, it is not impossible that it may have been brought from Egypt by Herodotus, who has not given it a place in his writings, but who appears to have studied Natural History with great minuteness while in that country. The vicinity of the priests and naturalists of Egypt to the numerous beautiful sponges which are known to abound in the Red Sea, that menagerie of zoophytes, would naturally tempt them to experiment on these animals, and would give any statements they might make regarding their living phenomena, great authority among the naturalists of Greece, and more distant countries.
But it seems more probable, that it took its rise in Greece, where we find it first mentioned, and may have been occasioned by the following circumstance. The sponges along the boisterous shores of the Hellespont, we are informed by Aristotle, were small, and of a hard texture, from the beating of the surge upon them; while they were much softer, and grew to greater magnificence, on the sheltered shores of the Peleponnesus. In the latter situation, their living properties could not fail to be frequently remarked by the naturalists of Argos, Sparta, Athens, and other large cities in that part of Greece, during their surveys of the maritime coasts; particularly as the sponge was, at that time, extensively used by the Greeks for many economical purposes to which it is not now applied: as for lining the heavy casques of warriors, to diminish their friction, &c . The great sponges along such calm and sultry bays, like the juicy aloe in the parched deserts of Arabia, are observed to fill themselves completely with water when in contact with that element, and to retain it for a long time undiminished. If, in this condition, they are but slightly pressed on the surface with the finger, the water with which their internal canals are filled, starts at once from several fecal orifices, in such a manner as would lead one at first to suppose, that the effect was produced by some effort or trembling of the animal. This, however, is entirely a mechanical effect, resulting from the elasticity of the strong horny spicula which lxumd the canals, and prevent them from changing their dimensions, or emptying themselves during the absence of the title. And when we attempt to tear these sponges from the rock, we feel a much more powerful resistance than could naturally be expected, from a substance so soft and plastic. This resistance might very easily be mistaken for a shrinking of the animal, but arises entirely from the mechanical structure of its skeleton; for, though the spicula which compose it arc soft, flexible, and plastic, they are not susceptible of being stretched, and they are Iinked together at their points of contact, by a very strong ligamentous opaque matter, equally incapable of extension, as we see in the Spongta communis, which we are constantly handling for domestic purposes. When we attempt, therefore, to stretch the living animal beyond a certain extent, the soft gelatinous matter escapes from every pore, and the animal cither slips quickly from our grasp, into its original position on the rock, or yields so suddenly by breaking, as to make it appear as if it had been resisting by some voluntary contractile effort.
The property of contracting when touched, had been so uniformly observed in animals low in the scale, and seemed so necessary to their functions and self-preservation, that few among the ancients ventured to call in question its existence in the sponge. I3ut as no one had ever distinctly observed such a motion in this substance, its real existence became very generally questioned by the botanists of more recent times; and particularly by those who devoted their attention to the study of marine plants. Ray, Touruefort, Bocrhaave, Marsigli, Linnaeus, Spallanzani, and nearly twenty naturalists of eminence during the last century might be quoted, who regarded the sponge as a vegetable, and destitute of contractile power But the numerous discoveries, both respecting the chemical principles and the actual existence of polypi, in many of the supposed marine plants, brought to light by Marsigli, Geoffroy, Lemery, Imperati, Gesner, Peyssonell, Cavolini, Trembly and Ellis, the distinct animal odour possessed by many sponges, both in their fresh and burnt state; the abundant gelatinous matter which occupies the interstices of the horny fibres; the palpitation of the fecal orifices, alleged by Marsigli, and the discharge of excrements from these apertures, discovered by Ellis, at length compelled naturalists to return to the ancient opinion of the animal-nature of the sponge, and to regard it as a kind of ambiguous zoophyte or animal, approaching nearly to the form and nature of a plant; in which opinion most zoologists at present agree. Linnaeus himself changed his former opinion of its vegetable nature; and in the later editions of his Systema Nature, classed it among animals.
The contractile power formerly ascribed to it by the Greeks, .was again revived rather from principle than from actual observation; and as this property had not been very distinctly manifested to modern zoologists, the statement of the ancients was adopted under a modified form. The sponge was now said to exhibit a kind of trembling motion when touched; and this equivocal sign of irritability is now ascribed to it by almost every modern zoologist. Cavolini and Montagu were of a contrary opinion; they considered the sponge as destitute of irritability; but from the want of decisive experiments, the most eminent naturalists still continue to ascribe that property to it, believing it somehow essential to its existence as an animal. It has been very recently stated by Mr Gray, that the small hard spherical opaque grains, disseminated in groups through the substance of the Spongilla, a genus considered as nearly allied to the present, and which Linnams formerly considered as the grains or seeds of this fresh-waterplant, actually enlarge, and become distinct spongillae, when preserved for a few days in water,- and from analogy with this substance, it is again maintained, that the true sponge is a marine plant, containing similar clusters of grains, and, consequently, a being destitute of contractile power.
Pallas, Solander, Ellis, Gmelin, Bruguiere and Lamouroux, consider the contraction of the sponge when touched, as an effect produced by the soft gelatinous matter which occupies the interstices of the horny fibres, while Lamarck and Cuvier seem to consider it as a property belonging to the entire mass of the animal. Lamarck, in his valuable memoir on this animal, and in his recent great work, has even entered into an explanation of the cause of this trembling motion or sudden contraction of its body when touched, by comparing it, as Ellis had done before him, with the Alcyonium; and he conceives, that the existence of this property in the sponge is indisputable, both from its analogy with these compound animals, and from the testimony of the Greeks. So great is the analogy, he conceives, between the sponge and the different species of Alcyonium, which present superficial polypi, projecting from a fleshy contractile base, that, if the sponge were examined under water with the necessary precautions, the polypi might be seen projecting from the gelatinous matter on its surface, and have hitherto escaped observation, only from their smallness and colourless transparency.
It is important to inquire, whether the mass of the sponge possesses any contractile power in the living state, because, in the absence of all positive evidence of the existence of polypi, this property of irritability constitutes its sole claim to be regarded as an animal in the zoological system of Lamarck, which is now adopted by most of the naturalists of Europe. As the division of matter into the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms, is entirely founded on assumed characters and arbitrary definitions, Lamarck has assumed irritability as the sole discriminating test of animal life, and has shown, that this singular property of reaction becomes less and less apparent as we approach the lower limit of the animal kingdom: And consequently, if the sponge cannot be made to manifest any sign of irritability, it must, upon his principles, be excluded from the animal kingdom, and must be regarded as a vegetable, from its other properties of growth and generation. The discovery of irritability in the mass of the sponge, would not only determine its true animal nature, but would likewise confirm the analogy, which has long been supposed to exist, between it and the alcyonium, and thus point out its true place in the scale of animals. This contractile power, if ascertained, would afford an easy and satisfactory explanation of the mysterious currents from the fecal orifices, for we might suppose, that, while one part of the animal dilated by its own elasticity to inhale water through the small superficial pores, other parts might be contracting to convey the streams along the internal canals, and propel them through the fecal orifices. It would likewise enable us to account for the shrinking motion of this animal, when roughly touched by the hand, or beaten by the winds and tempests, which was ascribed to it by some of the Greek naturalists. Or if the sponge could be satisfactorily shown to possess no such contractile power, or to possess it only in so low a degree as to afford no explanation of its living phenomena, our researches would then be necessarily directed to a new object; we would then have to inquire into some mysterious causes of the currents, totally independent of any general motions of the mass of the animal, and would thus have advanced one step nearer to the truth by limiting the object of our inquiry.
