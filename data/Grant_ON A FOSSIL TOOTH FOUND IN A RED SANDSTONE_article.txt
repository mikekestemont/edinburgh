
My Dear Sir, 

I RETURN you the interesting specimen of the Fossil Tooth in the Red Sandstone you had the kindness to submit to my examination, and I am greatly obliged to you for the opportunity you have afibrded me of forming my own opinion about a specimen, which is likely to be the subject of some controversy and speculation, in consequence of the judgment respecting it, 
pronounced by a most skilful and indefatigable anatomist, who has determined it to be the tooth of a wolf. As I am requested to state my opinion respecting the tooth, and as my examination of it has led me to a different conclusion from that of my able friend Mr Cliff, I feel called upon to justify that opinion, by stating the reasons that have led me to it. The white colour, the glistening surface, the conical and curved form, and the smoothness of the tooth, it is true, give it much the appearance of the canine tooth of a carnivorous quadruped, and its size and length I find to correspond nearly with that of the upper jaw of a wolf. But notwithstanding this general resemblance, on a closer examination the comparison entirely fails ; the tooth of the wolf is pi oportionably thicker and more curved, and is less com- 
pressed, particularly in its cavity for the pulp. The tooth of the wolf, and of other carnivorous quadrupeds, is covered on its crown with a thick layer of enamel, which resists the knife like 
glass, and which retains extreme density in the oldest fossil specimens ; the tooth in the rock is as soft as bone, and indeed you may cut it like a piece of gypsum with the softest knife. The 
tooth of the wolf and of other carnivorous quadrupeds, is never fluted around the base of the crown (the comparison is of course here made with the canine teeth) ; the fossil tooth is distinctly grooved around the outer margin of its base, and the rock is easily perceived to fill up these inequalities of its surface. At the base of the concave side of the fossil tooth, it expands more suddenly than that of a wolf, or similar carnivorous quadruped, but not more than teeth with which I shall presently compare it Of all the teeth of carnivorous quadrupeds, the canine are the most variable, in the same species, in their form and development, the most similar in different species (and even in different oiders of quadrupeds), and in the determination of fossil or existing animals, they afford the least satisfactory indications; 
next to them are the false molares ; then the incisors ; then the carnivorous tooth ; and the most important and influential are the tuberculated molares, which are the most constant in their forms, present the greatest number of points for comparison, and are the most intimately related to the kind of food and the whole organization and habits of the animal. I am therefore 
far from placing any reliance on the determination of a species of these animals, founded on the inspection of a small part of the outer surface of the crown of a canine tooth imbedded in a hard sandstone lock, and this was all that was exhibited of the tooth, when Mr Cliff was in possession of the specimen, and gave his opinion about it. 

I have removed the rock from the broadest part of the tooth and from its cavity, so as to obtain a full view of the transverse section of its base, the form of its cavity, and the structure and 
thickness of its parietes, so that I have had more points of comparison exposed, and more data on which to found my opinion. In all the teeth of quadrupeds approaching in form to this fossil tooth, there is a thick layer of enamel covering the crown, which is distinguished by its vitreous lustre, its translucency, its uniform compact texture, and its resistance to the point of the knife; and by these characters we can easily perceive the extent to which the enamelled coating passes down over the osseous substance of a recent or fossil tooth. I am well aware that there are many quadrupeds with angular teeth, where the enamel is found only on a small part of the surface, as in the incisors of Rodentia, &c., but none of these could be confounded with the tooth before me, which is obviously destitute of such a coating of enamel. Dr Prout, I understand, on his first inspection of the tooth, declared that it looked more like bone than enamel on the surface ; and I am convinced, after careful examination, that his opinion is correct, and that the tooth belongs to that class of animals where these organs are generally composed throughout of a soft osseous substance, which yields readily, on the surface as well as in the centre, to the point of the knife. In no quadruped, recent or fossil, is there a tooth approaching to this in general form, in which a section of the base of the crown presents a series of curves extending round it, as you perceive in this fossil, but such a structure is very common both in reptiles and fishes. There is no tooth of this form in quadrupeds which are destitute of a root to fix it in its alveolus ; but in this fossil you will perceive, by the groove which I have made in the rock at the base of the tooth, that there exists here no trace of a root in connexion with this crown. Would it be more philosophical to suppose that this tooth was that of a quadruped and once had a root, and that, before being imbedded in the soft sand which is now so hardened around it, it had been somehow neatly bisected at its thickest and strongest part, and only the crown is handed down to us ; or that it belonged to a class of 
animals in which the teeth consist only of osseous crowns, without a trace of root, or any alveolus to receive it, as is the case with most reptiles, and almost all fishes ? I purposely avoid adducing here any geological reasoning, which would materially support my view of this fossil, and wish to let the tooth speak entirely for itself, as a piece of anatomical structure. There is a great difference in the density both of the osseous substance and of the enamel of the teeth of quadrupeds, which is well known to those who are in the habit of cutting these substances to make artificial teeth, and as we pass through the cold-blooded vertebrata, the texture of both becomes softer, and the proportion of enamel becomes less, till it is entirely lost in fishes, where the teeth are often mere osseous spines, anchylosed to the supporting bone. Even the osseous part of a quadruped's tooth is denser than the surface of this fossil ; but I find I can match it in softness by my specimens of the Ichthyosaurus from the Lias, 
in which the surface of the teeth can be grooved with the slightest pressure of the knife, as in this fossil from the sandstone, and indeed in those recent lacertine and ophidian reptiles, in which the teeth are, like those of fishes, without roots or alveoli. In looking at the glistening surface of the osseous teeth of these saurian reptiles, serpents and fishes, one would little expect that soft texture which we find upon trial ; but their softness is admirably proportioned to the feeble attachment of their broad base, and to the necessity for their rapid growth and frequent renewal during life. I have compared this tooth with those of the larger loricated reptiles (crocodiles, gavials, and alligators) ; but besides the want of the root, which the teeth of these reptiles have, and the dense texture of these deeply fixed teeth, the fossil wants the longitudinal grooves with which these teeth are so constantly and minutely striated. It would be much more difficult to prove, that this is not the tooth of some of the Lacertida, where 
the teeth approach so near to those of fishes in their form and texture, and density, and want of roots, than to show that it is not like that of any known quadruped or loricated reptile. Taking the fossil tooth as an entire tooth, which has been preserved to us precisely as it fell from the jaw upon the loose sand, and I see no reason to doubt this ; its tapering, conical and curved 
form ; its soft and bony texture, its suddenly expanded base, the irregular projections and consequent waved outline of that base; its total want of a root to fix it in the jaw, and its wide rough cavity for the pulp at the base, are common characters of the teeth of a thousand osseous fishes at present inhabiting our seas, and have never yet been found, so far as I know, in the teeth of any recent or extinct quadruped. On a superficial inspection of the fossil tooth, any one might suppose (the form of the teeth of quadrupeds being more familiar to most than that of fishes), that it is simply the detached crown of a quadruped's canine tooth which has become softened by fossil ization, and has acquired a fractured margin around its base, by long pressure during the consolidation of the imbedding sandstone. I have compared the 
density of this supposed enamel with that of the oldest enamelled surfaces of quadruped's teeth which I possess, from the diluvial caves and from the chalk rubble, where they have been exposed to much moisture, and I have not found the enamel reduced to this coodition, although I have often found the osseous substance of such teeth reduced to a much softer condition, as in the ivory of mammoth's tusks. Besides, the walls of the fossil tooth are 
homogeneous in texture from the outer to the inner surface, and of equjl density on both surfaces, which could not be the case, were it composed of a thick layer of enamel covering a softer sheath of bone, as in quadruped's teeth. With regard to the curves described by the margin of the exposed base of the fossil tooth, they require only to be examined with a lens to observe their smoothness and symmetry, and to see that they constitute a part of the original formation of the tooth, which would form a remarkably expanded base, were they drawn out to one regular curve. I send you some teeth of the common Lophius piscaiorius, or angler-fish, which consist of a simple osseous crown, with an expanded corrugated base and wide rough cavity, nearly of the size and form of the fossil tooth, to show you in what manner that curved outline, so remarkable around the base of the fossil, is commonly produced in the teeth of fishes. 

And now I have given you my principal anatomical reasons, for questioning whether this be really the tooth of a wolf or of any other quadruped imbedded in the sandstone rock, which is all that you have given me time to do. I should like to have had leisure to compare its form with that of a series of the teeth of the larger osseous fishes, while I have no doubt, from the infinite variety of foims they present, that a hundred forms like this could easily be found. Indeed, Aom the great variety of forms presented by the teeth of the same fish, I could nearly match this fossil from the jaws of the Lopius and Lepisosteus before me. The original soft and spongy fish-like condition of the base of the forssil tooth, is still indicated by the particles of sand which you may perceive have sunk into its substance, and from the extent to which the red oxide of iron has permeated and coloured that part of the tooth. The teeth of fishes have generally a dark colour in calcareous and argillaceous deposits, from their osseous texture and the abundance of animal matter in that bony substance, but in siliceous deposits like this, they have a lighter colour, perhaps from the quicker disappearance of the animal matter. 

No one who has seen the imperfect condition of this relic, and understands the nature of the evidence it affords, would place much reliance on any attempt to identify it, or give confidence to any speculations founded on its determination; for one might, with almost equal show of plausibility, maintain it to be the claw of a crab, as the tooth of a wolf; and I have thrown out these doubts regarding the determination of this fossil, chiefly from observing the absurdities into which speculative geologists are sometimes led, by placing too much confidence in the determination of imperfect remains, which do not present the means of their identification.
