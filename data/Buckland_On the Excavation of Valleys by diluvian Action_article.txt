My intention in the following communication is to consider the general causes to which valleys owe their origin, and particularly such as occur in horizontal and undisturbed strata within the limits of their escarpments. That portion of the coast of Dorset and Devon which lies on the east of Lyme and on the east of Sidmouth, affords some of the best examples of such valleys with which I am acquainted: I beg therefore to present to the Society two geological views of that coast, drawn at my request some years since by Hubert Cornish, Esq., which will tend also further to illustrate the description given of it in a preceding paper by Mr. De la Beche.
Many valleys may be ascribed to the elevation or depression of the strata composing the adjacent hills, by forces acting at very remote periods from within the body of the earth itself; and to similar forces we may principally refer the high inclination and contortions of strata that occur in the highest mountains, and sometimes also in minor hills: other valleys have been occasioned by the strata having been originally deposited at irregular levels, and others by some partial slip or dislocation of portions of the strata.
But at different periods of time intermediate between the deposition of the most ancient and the most recent formations, the irregularities of level arising from the preceding causes have been variously modified by the action of violent inundations hollowing out portions of the surface and removing the fragments to a distance: to such circumstances we must ascribe the water-worn pebbles of the old red sandstone, the red marl, and the plastic clay formations.
  A cause similar to that last mentioned has wrought extensive changes on the surface (however variously modified by preceding catastrophes) at a period subsequent to the deposition and consolidation of the most recent of the regular strata; for rocks and strata of all ages bear on those portions of their surface which are not covered by other strata, the marks of aqueous excavation; and are strewed over with the mingled fragments of the most recent, as well as of the most ancient beds.
The diluvian waters to which these effects must be referred, (if we except the very limited and partial action of modern causes, such as of torrents in cutting ravines, of rivers in forming deltas, of the sea in eroding its cliffs, and of volcanos in ejecting and accumulating their exuviae,) appear to have been the last agents that have operated in any extensive degree to change the form of the earth's surface.
When one or more sides of a valley are formed by abrupt escarpments, such as usually terminate the outgoings of our secondary strata, it is difficult to say to what extent the discontinuity of the strata, and the formation of the valley beyond the limits of the escarpment, are attributable to diluvian excavation; for we know not how far the strata originally extended beyond their present frontier, nor how much of the subjacent valley is referable to other causes than the most recent diluvial agency: for example, it is not possible to determine how far the escarpment, which may be seen in the annexed map to terminate the green sand-hills of Blackdown towards the vale of Taunton, might have extended northward beyond its present boundary towards the Quantock hills; nor how much of this vale is to be attributed to excavation by water, or to originally low position: and we are equally without data for judging to what distance the same green sand might have originally extended on the west of Haldon towards Dartmoor; or over any spaces exterior to its present escarpments.
But when a valley originates and has almost its whole extent within the escarpment of strata that are horizontal or nearly so, and which bear no mark of having been moved from their original position by elevation, depression, or disturbance of any kind; and when such valley is inclosed along its whole course by hills that afford an exact correspondence of opposite parts, it must be referred exclusively to the removal of the substance that once filled it; and the cause of that removal appears to have been a violent and transient inundation.
  It is not easy to imagine how valleys of this last description could have heen formed in any conceivable duration of years by the rivers that now flow through them, since all the component streams, and consequently the rivers themselves which are made up of their aggregate, owe their existence to the prior existence of the valleys through which they flow.
  Of the same nature with those last described are the valleys which intersect the coast of Dorset and Devon. In passing along this coast (see the Map and Views, Plates XIII. and XIV.) we cross, nearly at right angles, a continual succession of hills and valleys, the southern extremities of which are abruptly terminated by the sea, the valleys gradually sloping into it, and the hills being abruptly truncated, and often overhanging the beach or underdid", with a perpendicular precipice. The main direction of the greater number of these valleys is from north to south; that is, nearly in the direction of the dip of the strata in which they arc excavated: the streams and rivers that flow through them arc short and inconsiderable, and incompetent, even when flooded, to move any thing more weighty than mud and sand.
The greater number of these valleys, and of the hills that bound them, are within the limits of the north and north-west escarpment of the green sand formation; and in their continuation southward they cut down into the oolite, lias, or red marl, according as this or that formation constitutes the substratum over which the green sand originally extended. There is usually an exact correspondence in the structure of the hills inclosing each valley; so that, whatever stratum is found on one side, the same is discoverable on the other side upon the prolongation of its plane: whenever there is a want of correspondence in the strata on the opposite sides of a valley, it is referable to a change in the substrata upon which the excavating waters had to exert their force.
The section of the hills in this district usually presents an insulated cap of chalk, or a bed of angular and unrolled chalk-flints, reposing on a broader bed of green sand; and this again rests on a still broader base of oolite, lias, or red marl (see Plates XIII. and XIV.). With the exception of the very local depression of the chalk and subjacent green sand and red marl on the west of the Axe, at Beer Cliffs, the position of the strata is regular and very slightly inclined; nor have any subterraneous disturbances operated to an important degree to affect the form of the valleys.
If we examine the valleys that fall into the bay of Charmouth from Burton on the east to Exmouth on the west, viz. that of the Bredy, the Brit, the Char, the Axe, the Sid, and the Otter, we shall find them all to be valleys of diluvian excavation; their flanks are similarly constructed of parallel and respectively identical becta; and the commencements of them all originate within the area and on the south side of the escarpment of the green sand.
The valley of the Sid, as it is coloured in the annexed map, may from its shortness and simplicity be taken as an example of the rest; it originates in the green sand, but soon cuts down to the red marl, and continues upon it to the sea; in both these respects it agrees with the upper branches of the Otter, and with the valleys that fall from the west into that of the Axe.
But in those cases where the lias and oolite formations are interposed between the red marl and green sand, the base of the valley varies with the variation of the substratum; as will appear on comparing the opposite sides of the lower valleys of the Otter, the Axe, and the Char, with the variations of their substrata, as expressed in the map.
The valley of Lyme is of equal simplicity with that of Sidmouth, and differs only in that its lower strata are composed of lias instead of red marl: but the valleys of Chideock, Bridport, and Burton, being within the area of the oolite formation, have their lower slopes composed of oolite subjacent to the green sand; whilst that of Charmouth is of a mixed nature, having its western branches in green sand reposing on lias, and in some of its eastern ramifications intersecting also the oolite. In the same manner, the valley of the Axe has lias interposed between the green sand and red marl on its east flank, but none at all on its western side, below the town of Axminster. These apparent anomalies form no exception to the general principle, that the variation of the sides of the valleys is always consistent with that which is simply referable to the variation of the substrata, on which the denuding waters had to exert their force. It is moreover such as can be explained on no other theory than that of the strata having at one time been connected continuously across the now void spaces which constitute the valleys.
The following section, taken from a series of lias quarries on the two opposite sides of the valley of the Axe near Axminster, will show the degree of minuteness to which this correspondence extends:
  All the above strata are separated by thin beds of clay, varying from four inches to a foot, and exceeding the latter thickness in one case only, viz. between 10 and 11: but the presence and relative position of each individual stratum of stone is constant; and the specific character and uses of each bed are of practical notoriety among the masons through the district round Axminster, in which there are many and distant quarries, to any one of which the above section is equally applicable; e. g. to the quarries of Fox hills on the south-east, of Waycroft on the north, and of Sisterwood, Battleford, Long Leigh, Small-ridge, Green-down, and Cox-wood, on the north-west of Axminster. There can be little doubt, therefore, that the component strata of all these quarries were originally connected in one continuous plane across the now void space which forms the valley of the Axe.
The fact of excavation is evident from simple inspection of the manner in which the valleys intersect the coast, on the east of Sidmouth and the east of Lyme, as represented in the annexed views (Plate XIV.) and it requires but little effort, either of the eye or the imagination, to restore and fill up the lost portions of the strata, that form the flanks of the valleys of Salcomb, Dunscomb, and Branscomb, on the east of Sidmouth; or of Charmouth, Seatown, and Bridport, on the east of Lyme. By prolonging the corresponding extremities of the strata on the opposite flanks, we should entirely fill up the valleys, and only restore them to the state of continuity in which they were originally deposited.
  An examination of the present extent and state of the remaining portions of the chalk formation within the district we are considering, will show to what degree the diluvian waters have probably interrupted its original continuity. The insulated mass of chalk, which at Beer Head composes the entire thickness of the cliff, rises gradually westward with a continual diminution and removal of its upper surface; till after becoming successively more and more thin, on the cliffs of Branscomb, Littlecomb, and Dunscomb, it finds in the latter its present extreme western boundary: beyond this boundary, on the top of Salcomb Hill and of all the highest table lands and insulated summits of the interior, from the ridges that encircle the vales of Sidmouth and Honiton to the highest summits of Blackdown, and even of the distant and insulated ridge of Haldon on the west of the valley of Exe, beds of angular and unrolled chalk flints (which can be identified by the numerous and characteristic organic remains which they contain) are of frequent occurrence; similar beds are found also on the green sand summits that encircle the valleys of Charmouth and Axminster; other large and insulated masses of chalk occur, along the coast from Lyme nearly to Axmouth, and in the interior, at Widworthy, Membury, White Stanton, and Chard; and these at distances varying from ten to thirty miles from the present termination of the chalk formation in Dorsetshire; though within the limits of the original escarpment of the green sand.
These facts concur to show that there was a time when the chalk covered all those spaces on which the angular chalk flints are at this time found: and that it probably formed a continuous or nearly continuous stratum, from its present termination in Dorsetshire, to llaldon on the west of Exeter.
From the correspondence observed by Mr. Wm. Phillips between the strata of Dover and on the hills west of Calais, and by Mr. De la Bee lie between the strata of the coast of Dorset and Devon, and those of Normandy J, it may be inferred (after making due allowance for the possible influence of those earlier causes, which in many instances have occasioned valleys) that the English Channel is a submarine valley, which owes its origin in a great measure to diluvian excavation, the opposite sides having as much correspondence as those of any valleys on the land. Mr. De la Beche, as I am informed, has already drawn the same inference from his own observations. According to Bouache, the depth of the straits of Dover is on an average less than 180 feet; and from thence westward to the chops of the channel the water gradually deepens to only 420 feet, a depth less than that of the majority of inland valleys which terminate in the bay of Charmouth; and as ordinary valleys usually increase in depth from the sides towards their centre, so also the submarine valley of the channel is deepest in the middle, and becomes more shallow towards either shore.
  It seems probable that a large portion of the matter dislodged from the valleys of which we have been speaking by the diluvian waters that hollowed them out, has been drifted into the principal valley, the bed of the sea; and being subsequently carried eastward by the superior force of the flowing above that of the ebbing tide, and partially stopped in its further progress by the Isle of Portland, has formed that vast bed of pebbles known by the name of the Chesil Bank: the principal ingredients of this bank are rolled chalk flints and pebbles of chert; the softer materials that filled the valleys, such as chalk, sand, clay, and marl, having been floated off and drifted far into the ocean, by the violence of the diluvian waters.
The quantity of diluvian gravel which remains lodged upon the slopes and in the lower regions of the valleys that intersect this coast, is very considerable; but it is not probable that many animal remains will be discovered in it, because the large proportion of clay with which it usually is mixed, renders it less fit for roads than the shattered chert strata of the adjacent hills, and consequently gravel pits are seldom worked in 'the diluvium. Enough, however, has been done to identify its animal remains with those of the diluvian gravel of other parts of England, by the discovery, a few years since, of several large tusks of Elephants and teeth of'Rhinoceros in the valleys of Lyme and Charmouth.
  On the highest parts of Blackdown, and on the insulated summits which surround the vale of Charmouth, I have found abundantly pebbles of fat quartz; which must have been drifted thither from some distant primitive or transition country, and carried to their actual place, before the present valleys were excavated and the steep escarpments formed, by which those high table lands are now on every side bounded. These cases are precisely of the same nature with those of the blocks of granite that lie on the mountains of the Jura and on the plains of the north of Germany and Russia, and with that of the quartzose pebbles found on the tops of the hills round Oxford and Henley; which latter I have described in the fifth volume of the Geological Transactions, as having been drifted thither from the Licky Hill and central parts of England, before the excavation of the present valley of the Thames.
