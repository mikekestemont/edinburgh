
GENTLEMEN - We open the sixth session of our medical school with prospects equally gratifying to the profession, and to those who are interested in the prosperity of this establishment. The ruinous expenditure with which the University commenced its career has been greatly reduced, and, by recent internal arrangements, it is now brought within its present actual income. New chairs are proposed and announced, and new lectureships will commence this winter. The whole system of management in relation to the students, the lectures, the professors, the faculties, the senate, and the council, has been carefully planned and organised. Several important improvements have been made since last session, both in the interior and exterior of the building, and additions have been made to our libraries, apparatus,
drawings, and museums. The inconvenience of teaching two extensive analytical departments, requiring much apparatus and means of illustration, in the same theatre, has been remedied by the arrangement of a new theatre, expressly for the class of materia medica, in which the whole of the rich materials for that branch are placed constantly before the eye of the student. The juvenile school, the success of which, last season, with imperfect accommodation, surpassed the most sanguine hopes, has been accommodated with new and spacious apartments within the University, thus forwarding the in ternal completion of the building ; and it is reasonable to expect that the prosperity of that part of the establishment will prove beneficial to the medical and general schools by sending up students to those departments, if the general school of the University be not allowed to sink into a school for children. The Dispensary, hitherto maintained at considerable expense, and the only means we possessed of
communicating clinical instruction, will now soon be relinquished for the hospital adjoining the University, which has been entirely built since the close of the last session, and now only waits for its internal furnishing to receive the patients. The opening of the NORTH LONDON HOSPITAL will be the commencement of two important departments of our medical curriculum,-clinical medicine and clinical surgery, with hospital attendance. The debts of the establishment, which, last winter, excited some anxiety regarding the stability of this school, have, as you have seen by the public journals, all been paid off by a loan of 4000 £ on a mortgage of property for five years, and it is confidently expected, from the increasing prosperity and reputation of the schools, and the plans of rigid economy introduced, that it will be redeemed within that period, and the future existence of the whole placed on a more solid foundation. But, in case of difficulties, is it unreasonable to hope that in subscribing for its erection, half the nobility, and power, and wealth of England are pledged to prop this monument to the genius of the times? The subdivision of labour in the medical school, the extended courses of instruction given on every department of medicine, and the ample means of illustration we already possess, place this part of the Institution on an equality with that of any other British University in these respects, and an application has lately been made to parliament, by a zealous and learned member of our council and of the legislature, to petition his Majesty to grant this house a charter, with the power of conferring degrees, as enjoyed by the endowed Universities of the kingdom. This appeal has met with a most favourable reception in the House of Commons, and lated to awaken the finest feelings and its object is said to be now under the consideration of the advisers of the Crown. The Royal College of Physicians of Londen exercise an exclusive power over the profession, which is injurious to its interests, and an unjust oppression. No physician can demand an examination for a fellowship at that College, in virtue of any degree but that of the imperfect medical school of Oxford and Cambridge; and no student can obtain degree in these two Universities, unless he sign the thirty-nine articles as a member of the Church of England. Thus the object of such a College is absurdly perverted, and very few of the eminent physicians of England can obtain a fellowship, or expect to enjoy those advantages and privileges which are attached to it. Forty-nine physicians, of known reputation, practising in London, including the heads of most of the medical schools of the metropolis, excepting King’s College, have petitioned the House of Commons to inquire into this and other abuses of the profession, and, generally, into its present state throughout the country, with the view to the framing of such laws as may remove the existing evils, and place the medical institutions of this country on a more liberal and equitable basis. Petitions to the same effect have been presented from other parts of the kingdom. Notice of motion for a committee of inquiry has been given in the House of Commons, and the affairs of the profession are now in the hands of a scrutinizing and equitable legislature, which will retain whatever is good in the institutions of old times, and correct whatever abuses are sanctioned only by custom or neglect. So that if priviliges are to be granted to this school, either as a part or the whole of a great metropolitan University, they will be founded, not on special favour, or the caprice of the times, but on a full and candid examination of its comparative  merits, and on the broad principles of reason, expediency, and public good;  and, it is to be hoped, they will be in accordance with the present enlightened condition  of society, and the liberal  principles of the age. Those, to whom I now chiefly address  myself, who are about to commence their medical education in this establishment, have reason to be gratified with the prospects of the school they have selected, and to congratulate themselves on the light of reform  and improvement which begins to  dawn on the profession they are about to enter; a profession, the study of which, under  all circumstances, presents a vast and varied field for the exercise of the mental powers, whose pursuits are calculated to awakend the finest feelings and the noblest endowments of our nature ; and the practice of which is peculiarly calculated to promote happiness, by removing or alleviating the sufferings of humanity.
The task you are about to enter upon is the most serious of your life, as ours is the most responsible. The education of youth, indeed, is the most important subject which can occupy the human mind; it is the basis of individual happiness, and of the rank and usefulness of man in society; it developes and cultivates those powers which distinguish him from the brute ; it stamps the character of an age, and constitutes the chief distinction among men, and among the nations that are, or have been, on the earth. An extensive and well-directed general education, by cultivating and improving the mental faculties, storing the mind with the materials of thought, and training it early to habits of study and reflection, forms a most valuable introduction to professional pursuits, and a solid foundation for professional fame. This early preparation, so valuable in all the learned professions, is of essential importance in the study of medicine, whose objects and pursuits are so numerous, extensive, and varied. The youth destined for this profession, who is yet only acquiring a knowledge of the Latin language, is not merely obtaining the means of enjoying, in after life, the literature of the ancient mistress of the world; he is acquiring the language in which half the works of his future profession are written,—the language he must daily employ in his prescriptions and practice,—the language from which the technical terms of anatomy, surgery, and the half of the medical science, are derived: and by studying its structure, its combinations, and decompositions, he is training the mind to the processes of analysis and synthesis, so important in all the analytical parts of medicine, as chemistry, pharmacy, and medical jurisprudence. The nomenclature of chemistry, botany, and some other branches of medicine, is derived chiefly from the Greek, the simplicity and vocal harmony of which admirably suit it for this use; and an acquaintance with that rich and beautiful language is thus valuable to the medical student, not only as a key to the pure fountain of science and literature among the Greeks, and to the writings of Hippocrates, Aristotle, Galen, and other fathers of medicine, but also to enable him to comprehend the descriptive language of the scientific medical works published throughout Europe at the present time. Although the study of the dead languages is a valuable part of the student's education, in giving an early discipline to his mind, in cultivating his taste by the purest models of literature, in affording him access to all that is most curious and interesting in the history of his profession, and in interpreting its technical language, the useful knowledge to be obtained through their means, falls infinitely short of that to which he can obtain access only by an acquaintance with the modern languages of Europe, particularly the French and German. The number of flourishing Universities and Medical Schools on the Continent, and the numerous improvements they are daily adding to science, now render it indeed impossible to keep pace with the rapid march of discovery in any department of our profession, without some tolerable acquaintance with the modern languages. But there is no language which the student of medicine is more apt to neglect, or requires more, than his own, which he has constant occasion to use in the various writings and correspondence of an active professional life. In a science like medicine, so replete with subjects of speculation and conjecture, that precision of thought acquired by cultivating the sciences which treat of quantity and figure, is most valuable. And independent of the value of the mathematical sciences in teaching the mind to think and to reason correctly, they have many direct applications to particular branches, as to the analytical parts of chemistry. The numerous useful applications of natural philosophy, of optics, acoustics, mechanics, hydrostatics, and other branches of that vast and practical department, are so obvious that, in a liberal plan of medical education; it ought to enter as a necessary part. Without its aid half the beauty of animal structure is undiscoverable, and half the science of physiology is unintelligible. It stands beside chemistry in its relation to medicine, and to the light which it throws on vital phenomena, and its facts and principles are alike applicable to the healthy and the diseased conditions of organization. There never was a period when the philosophy of mind and the art of correct reasoning were more important to the medical student than the present, when the most discordant opinions divide the profession regarding the phenomena of sensation and thought, the nature of life, of volition, and mental emotions, the functions of the brain, and the whole constitution of the human mind. Although medicine is replete with subjects of abstruse investigation, requiring a mind well disciplined in the abstract sciences, the practice of the profession makes constant calls on our acquaintance with the resources of nature, contained in the properties of the natural objects around us. In combating disease, we seek aid from every kingdom of nature; from the mineral kingdom we derive an immense number of powerful agents, possessing the most diversified properties; the vegetable kingdom contributes largely to the materia medica, and many remedial agents of great power and efficacy are taken from the animal kingdom. Not only do the studies of mineralogy, botany, and zoology contribute to enrich medicine with numerous effective remedies for the evils that flesh is heir to, but even geology throws the greatest light on medical star tistics, or medical police, an important part of medical jurisprudence. An acquaintance with these general departments of knowledge should form the basis of a medical education, and to ensure the usefulness and respectability of the profession, the highest honours in medicine ought to be granted only to those who have obtained previously some testimonial of proficiency in general acquirements. This College and King's College differ from the other medical schools of the metropolis, in presenting the student with the means of obtaining a knowledge of these preliminary branches, while pursuing his medical studies, without quitting the walls of the establishment; and you who are but commencing your career, I would venture to remind, that as yours is still the period to store up intellectual treasures, more imperishable than worldly, for future life, you should avail yourselves of the means that are now before you, to supply the deficiencies of your early education; or, hereafter, in the army or the navy, in the provinces or in remote colonies, in the bustle of an active life, you may in vain regret the last opportunity you have lost. A curriculum of professional study comprehends, not the preparatory studies, hut those professional departments only which the student is required to attend before he can obtain some testimonial or diploma, and, in this institution, the curriculum unanimously proposed by the medical faculty for the diploma of "Master in Medicine and Surgery," comprehends only the subjects taught by the professors of that faculty. The subjects of the course of study it prescribes, are intimately connected with each other as parts of a whole, and a methodical order in their study tends much to facilitate their acquisition. Anatomy and chemistry derive very little aid from other branches of mediunderstood when seen, without an acquaintance with the structure of the part, and this knowledge is equally necessary to comprehend the seat or nature of any internal disease. The study of human bones and muscles, and other parts of our frame, to which the young student is soon introduced, is often commenced with feelings of natural repugnance; but the beauty of perfect adaptation which he sees in every part, and the professional importance he finds attached to every the minutest point of the structure, soon change these feelings for those of the liveliest curiosity, interest, and admiration. To behold the complex structure of our solid frame-work, and the means by which its parts are held in connexion, and enabled to move smoothly on each other; to study the complicated machinery by which all the motions of the body are effected, and the curious apparatus provided to give it cognizance of outward nature; to examine the instruments by which it converts foreign matter into its own likeness, and the hydraulic apparatus to convey it for the nourishment of all the parts; to study the beautiful means provided to bring the restoring element without, largely in contact with the fluids within, and the organs by which new compounds are formed from the circulating fluids, or the decayed materials are removed from the system; to penetrate those mysterious arrangements by which his race is perpetuated on the earth—in short, to behold how "fearfully and wonderfully" man is made, is calculated to present the student with themes for the most interesting reflection, to gain his heart to his study, and to open his mind to the purest feelings and sentiments of religion. As a knowledge of the healthy structure of our frame is the basis of morbid and comparative anatomy, the parent of the arts of design, and the key-stone of surgery, so is chemistry the foundation of pharmacy, and essential to the study of medical jurisprudence and of physiology. Even anatomy borrows from it a knowledge of the composition and nature of the fluids and tissues of our body. But chemistry, shining with an unborrowed light, spreads its lustre over half the physical sciences. Confining its inquiries to the phenomena which result from the motions of invisible atoms at insensible distances, its field of research is limited only by the boundaries of the material world. The heat and light of the comet that seems to shoot beyond the starry firmament, the meteors of the heavens, the artillery of the clouds, the atmosphere that encompasses the globe, the waters that bathe its surface, the solid earth itself, and the processes of its hidden laboratories, are as much the domain of the chemist, and as rigidly obey his laws, as the complex living processes performed in the laboratory of organic beings, from man to the humblest lichen. What a mine of research is opened to the student by this delightful study! It is no less important among the sciences for the innumerable useful applications of its results, and the splendour of its discoveries, than it is satisfactory to the mind from the certainty of its evidence, and gratifying by the beauty of its experiments. The student's mind, familiarized with human structure, and enlarged by chemical research, begins to reflect that to know man isolated, is to know him but half; that our knowledge of things is mostly relative; that he cannot compare while he knows but one term of the comparison. Our species is one of half a million of organized beings; and to know the true character of man’s organization, and his place in the scale of nature, is to know something of the degrees of that scale. Knowing the structure of man's brain, or heart, or eye, or ear, or hand, the student can perceive nothing of superiority, nothing peculiar in them, till he has compared them with the range of forms presented by those organs in nature, and perceives why each form is best in the combinations of structure which accompany it. He traces, in comparative anatomy, the human organs coming successively into being, and rising in complexness, from the monad through all the grades of animal existence ; and discovers, by the close resemblance which exists between the transient forms presented by man's organs during their development, and their permanent or adult forms in inferior orders of animals, that the plan of organization is everywhere the same, and man the climax of its development. Extending his view to the remnants of organic beings embalmed in the earth, he finds that this kingdom has itself been gradually developed, from simple to compound, that its roots are lost in the depth of the earth, and its extreme branches only are visible on the surface. This extensive department treats of the composition and properties of the fluids and tissues of animal bodies, the structure and development of the several organs, and the uses or functions of every part, thus constituting the general and descriptive anatomy of animals and animal physiology. Seeing the imperfect knowledge of man to be derived from studying man alone, physiologists, in all ages, have sought to comprehend and illustrate his vital economy by studying that of inferior animals; and their labours have thus been rewarded by the discovery of the circulation of the blood, the lacteal vessels, the thoracic duct, the lymphatic absorbents, the principle of galvanism, the functions of the nerves, and many others, made on the lower animals, which have changed the whole face of medical science. Comparative anatomy, like chemistry and botany, spurning its origin as subservient to man's economy, or to medicine, has assumed an independent rank among the sciences, and has extended its influence over zoology, geology, and the fine arts. From the structure of man and animals the student passes to that of plants—to the study of Botany, one of the most extensive and pleasing departments of the medical curriculum, and one which has long been cherished and protected in our universities and medical schools, by the regulations of public bodies and the guardians of education. Treating of the structure and functions and history of vegetables, it stands in the same relation to medicine as comparative anatomy, animal physiology, and zoology, taken collectively, which have never been protected by our profession. The first development and the lowest conditions of the organs of vegetative life, and the phenomena of life exhibited by the simplest forms of organization, the nature and functions of the vegetable tissues and vessels,—the phenomena of circulation in the cells,—the eudosmose of the roots,— the motions of the sap in inert vessels,— the respiration of the leaves,—the signs of sensibility,—the whole phenomena of fructification and germination,—the influence of external agents on the vital phenomena of plants, and on vegetable forms,—the laws which regulate their physical and geographical distribution, arid whatever relates to the living economy of this vast kingdom of nature, are calculated to enlarge the views of the comparative anatomist and physiologist. The principles of classification as applied to vegetable forms, anil the history of the families and species, form an indispensable preliminary to the study of materia medica. Although medicine is thus largely indebted to the delightful pursuits of the botanist, botany is so little subordinate to physic, that, in all countries, it is a favourite study with men of every calling, and the most distinguished botanists in our own country have seldom belonged to the medical profession, as BROWN, HOOSER, GREVILLE, LINDLEY, ARNOT, and BSKTHAM. The living functions of plants and animals are the province of physiology, which examines the processes by which foreign matter, introduced into these living laboratories, is converted into their own likeness, the manner in which they are affected by surrounding nature, and the means by which they continue their race. Resting on anatomy, human, comparative, and vegetable, and using the light of natural philosophy and chemistry, it examines the machinery in a state of action, to determine how far each part contributes to the general result; and by accurately defining the healthy function of each organ in the general vortex of life, it paves the way for the study of pathology, which considers them in a state of disease. It is here divided into three departments, vegetable, animal, and human physiology, which are considered separately in the classes of botany, comparative anatomy, and human anatomy. Accident and experiment, more than reasoning, have pointed out many mineral, vegetable, and animal substances, which exert peculiar and often extraordinary powers, when taken into the living body—powers by which the vital functions are variously modified, the fluids altered in composition and properties, and the textures of the organs changed or destroyed. These are the chief instruments employed by the physician to check the progress of morbid actions and restore the healthy; and as each exerts, under similar circumstances, its own peculiar action, they can be classified according to their properties, and their degrees of activity can be determined with precision. Hence has arisen that extensive and important department, materia medica, which treats of the properties of medicinal agents, the art of pharmacy, by which they are procured from nature, and prepared for administration, and therapeutics, which explains their mode of action on the living frame. This study constantly directs the student's knowledge of chemistry to practical purposes; it changes empiricism to science, and gives to the medical student a new interest in the study of the three kingdoms of nature. The student who has seen all parts of the human body demonstrated and described, and, in his private study, has diligently kept pace with the professors of the elementary departments, is prepared to take the scalpel into his own hand, and, under the guidance of the demonstrator, to print in his mind, by actual dissection, the form, structure, appearance, and relations of every part. In the dissecting rooms he studies not merely the parts prepared hy himself, but those of all his companions. The anatomical, physiological, and surgical relations of every part are practically demonstrated, and are repeated in a continuous course of demonstrations, so that by this most valuable part of his studies, he is not only prepared to follow the minutest details of surgery, pathology, and the higher practical branches, but is enabled to satisfy himself regarding all obscure points which may be the subject of discussion in his other classes, or in his private reading. By thus becoming familiarized with the healthy structure and functions of the body, the best foundation is laid for the study of the diseased, and of all the practical branches connected with the morbid, condition of parts. The origin and nature of those changes of composition and texture to which every organ is liable, and which form the prelude to changes of structure more seriously affecting their functions, or altogether destroying them,— the characters by which all derangements of structure are determined and distinguished, and their effects on the functions and the whole economy,—are subjects belonging to morbid anatomy, a department which obviously tends to substitute demonstration for conjecture in the theory of disease, and to lay a solid foundation for rational practice, but one which only the discernment of our own time has recognised as a necessary and independent part of a medical curriculum. As the pathologist extends his inquiries alike to the external and internal organic derangements, his discoveries are alike important to the surgeon, the physician, and the medical jurist. This knowledge of healthy structure may teach the surgeon how to operate, but when to operate he must learn from the diseased. The skilful administration of internal remedies or external applications can often change the internal diseased structure of an organ, and restore its healthy condition; but when the morbid part resists all such means, and must be removed, it calls for the last resources and often the boldest triumphs of the healing art. The surgeon is trained to view the living and the dead, the healthy and the diseased, with equal self-command. In the dissecting-room and the theatre he is familiarized with the use of all his instruments, and the structure of the.part he is to cut. By the study of morbid anatomy he has lost all feeling of disgust at the sight of diseases the most hideous; that tyro's feeling is changed for one of a more abstract character; he sees in them only peculiar conditions of the cellular tissue, increased action of the absorbents, increased vascularity, turgescence of the veins, vitiated secretions of the capillaries, fine specimens of rare or nondescript appearances, or beautiful confirmations of some favourite theory; and that philosophic calmness is most valuable to him at the moment when death everywhere surrounds his knife, and he is endeavouring to convey all his knowledge to its point. The operations of surgery may be viewed by the physiologist as experiments on the powers of the living frame. The study of this department points out the practical utility of every part of anatomy, and also of materia medica, physiology, and other branches, and it opens to the mind prospects of usefulness, and sources of the most exalted enjoyment,—the successful performance of operations deemed impossible—the saving of a bosom friend from certain death—the restoring a valuable member to society, or a patriot to his country—the inspiring of confidence in the field of battle. As the student in the dissecting-room tests the value of the instructions received in the theatre of anatomy; so by the clinical part of surgery he is made to perceive, in the wards and theatre of the hospital, the truth of the doctrines explained in the class-room. To the inexperienced observer half the evils that afflict our frame produce no outward sign, but the experienced physician reads in the posture of the body, the state of the breathing or the breath, the colour and expression of the face, the eyes, the tongue, the lips, the condition of the skin, the excretions, the pulse, the sound of the stethoscope, and a thousand minute circumstances, the whole progress and workings of the hidden malady. His penetrating eye sees through the body, examines each organ, ascertains the advance and the whole disposition and strength of the enemy, plans his mode of attack and the forces he is to employ, and, with the promptitude of a general trained in the field, darts on the foe at his most vulnerable part. This quick perception and interpretation of the outward signs, and ready determination of their causes, effects, and antidotes, is not the work of genius or inspiration, hut the slow result of long and well-directed study and observation of all that relates to the healthy and morbid conditions of the human frame;—it is the gift of a mind developed by polite education, stored hy a liberal career of professional studies, and corrected by the careful ohservation of all forms of disease, and particularly of such as affect the constitution at large or the deep-seated organs. The department termed the Principles and Practice of Medicine, conveys to the student the fruits of this experience, and explains the general principles which can he with safety deduced from it, as regards the characters, the origin, the causes, the indications, the effects, the remedies, and the whole history of such diseases. Clinical medicine, like clinical surgery, is that by which the student learns at the bedside of the patient, the truth and value of the precepts and theories explained in the classroom, and is the best preliminary to his entering on the responsible duties of a physician. Detached from physic and surgery, yet partaking of both, is the province of the accoucheur—midwifery, and the diseases of women and children—a department which involves the most intricate parts of anatomy and physiology, the nicest and the holdest operations of surgery, and the most perplexing and difficult cases of the practice of medicine. The whole uterine system, and the changes it undergoes, the phenomena of impregnation and conception, the development of the embryo, and the systems of the foetus, the diseases of pregnancy, the difficulties of labour, and the operations required to assist it, the ambiguous maladies incident to the puerperal state, the theory and phenomena of menstruation, the critical diseases of infants and children,—are among the suhjects to which the student's attention is directed in this extensive field of study and practice. Having for its subjects the fair sex and the helpless infant, it is, in study, perhaps the most gratifying department of the profession, but in practice the most trying to the heart, the mind, and the body. The highest branch of the curriculum, the most responsible department of the profession, and one requiring the most extensive and varied attainments, is certainly medical jurisprudence; a department of modern date, closely connecting medicine with legislation, and which has arisen, like laws, from the vices of men. The vices of Nero, Caligula, and Caracalla, have heen surpassed by the refined enormities of our own days. Society, which developes the powers of man, gives refinement to vice as well as to virtue; and in proportion as vice has become more cunning, the searching law has redoubled its energies to hunt it out. Poisoning, suffocation, hurning, secret wounds, starvation, torture, suicide, rape, hanging, drowning, infanticide, are among the prerogatives of our species, and the subjects of study for the medical jurist. How many a victim has sunk unheeded into the grave, and left the murderer to steal unsuspected through the rest of life! But now the carcass, gone to shreds, can be made to stand in appalling judgment against the murderer, and render him the poison, grain for grain. Medicines are poisons, and the more virulent the more valuable, in skilful hands, which can make them act like magic on the most stubborn frame; but ignorance and crime are daily administering them in mortal doses; and an intricate branch of medical jurisprudence, toxicology, is chiefly occupied with the discovery of means to detect their presence before or after death, and to counteract their virulence during life. In medical inquests on the dead body, where the life of an innocent accused is often at stake, the nicest acquaintance with morbid anatomy is often required, to distinguish the natural effects of disease or incipient decay from the consequences of recent injuries, or the morbid changes produced by poisons; and the detection of the various poisons, under such circumstances, often demands the profoundest knowledge of chemical analysis. Indeed, from the importance and the variety of the subjects which come under the cognizance of the medical jurist, he requires not only the greatest professional knowledge and experience, but great presence of mind, and candour, and a judgment clear, ready, and unbiassed. Such are the departments taught by the medical faculty of this estahlishment, and to facilitate their acquisition, as well as to diminish the expense to the student, he has constant access to a medical library, containing many valuable works and plates, and to a museum of anatomy already equal to that of any medical school in the metropolis. A separate museum is formed for the departments of comparative anatomy, comparative physiology, and zoology, in which these subjects are taught. In common with all other medical schools of London, we are still destitute of a botanic garden, but the connexion of our learned professor of botany with the Horticultural Society of London fortunately enables him to prevent that deficiency from being felt. For the illustration of morbid anatomy the University possesses an immense collection of coloured drawings, executed by the professor of that department himself from actual diseases, and the most interesting parts which they represent are preserved in spirit in the Museum, together with the history of the cases ; this department, which is also illustrated by the dissection of recent morbid parts, must be greatly increased in interest and value by the approaching opening of the hospital. Many of the professors give private practical instructions in their respective departments, which, in such complicated studies as Chemistry and Pharmacy, must be invaluable to those who can avail themselves of those advantages. The whole of the rich materials for the illustration of Materia Medica and Pharmacy, are the private property of the professor of that branch, and exhibit the splendid result of an active life especially devoted to the cultivation of this department. For the obstetrical department, the University has been so fortunate as to purchase the whole of the beautiful preparations and machinery of the late museum of Professor DAVIS. The spacious apartments for practical anatomy arc conveniently placed apart from the general building, by which the students can devote themselves to that study, without the inconvenience or the risk of interruption. And every department of the curriculum is provided with whatever specimens, apparatus, instruments, drawings, diagrams, and other means of illustration, the experience of the past years has shown to be useful in communicating knowledge. Until the Hospital is completely ready for the admission of pupils, the usual duties will be performed at the University Dispensary. The Medical Society of the University, composed of students, is calculated to forward the great objects of the school, by promoting a generous emulation in study, and an agreeable interchange of knowledge, by reproving the wayward, and encouraging the good dispositions of its youthful members, by tying early bonds of friendship, which will be the means hereafter of extending their professional acquaintance, and by promoting that unanimity of sentiment and kindly feeling for the prosperity of the Institution which has ever characterised our medical students. The more diligent students have also opportunities, at the monthly evening conversations held in the museum, of conversing with their more advanced professional brethren, and with the friends of the Institution, who favour us with their company on those occasions. With such means of instruction, and by the conscientious discharge of our several duties as teachers, our medical school, and the general establishment, without privileges or endowments of any kind, have continued to prosper, and to gain in public estimation, and, in conjunction with King's College, almost to afford the advantages of a university to this great metropolis. Indeed, the best privilege which a university can possess, is the means of teaching the greatest number of polite sciences in the most efficient manner; and, without the secure possession of these means, all adventitious privileges and dignities are absurd vanities, calculated to benefit only a few individuals, who may be protected by such privileges; to excite petty jealousies among teachers, by establishing inequalities of rank; to rouse the odium of the profession by a monopoly of privilege and an assumedsuperiority; and to deceive the public with a false show of stability. Here, all is harmony, all are animated with equal zeal: here a liberal council is ever watchful to curb the ambitious and protect the oppressed,—an advantage wanting in other private schools. Here no invidious distinctions have yet sown the seeds of dissension, or damped the ardour of the teacher; the enthusiasm of each in his own field of inquiry excites a kindred ardour in the youthful student; and the business of education is still an unmingled source of satisfaction and delight. Our institution is based on the most rational and solid foundation which an unendowed university could justly desire; not on monopoly or exclusive rights, which generally protect only such common-place or lucrative subjects as require no protection, and leave those higher departments of science to perish, which alone constitute the difference between a university and a private school; but on the liberality of its principles, on the congenial sentiments of an enlightened public, and on its efficiency as a school for the sciences which it professes to teach. The busy hand of reform, everywhere aiding reason against custom and power in establishing the rights of man, is nowhere more wanted than in the medical institutions of our country, to adapt them to the present improved state of the profession, and to the present wants and condition of society. The exclusive obnoxious power gradually usurped by the College of Physicians of London, is contrary to reason, justice, expediency, and public good. The system of apprenticeships to apothecaries and surgeons is a system of menial occupation, idleness, or vice; it is a remnant of the low and ignorant state of the profession in olden times; it serves only to secure pecuniary advantages and gratuitous service to a few inte rested men, but is ruinous to the education and character of our youths, degrading to the medical profession, and injurious to the community at large. By shortening the period of our medical curriculum in this University, in consequence of the duration of apprenticeships, we sink the value of our diploma, as a testimonial of knowledge, by one year's study, beneath that of Edinburgh; we countenance an abuse which we ought to endeavour to remedy; and, in place of extending medical education by our new institution, we curtail its advantages beneath the existing standard, as if cheaper honours were to be more coveted. From the abuses which encumber institutions of ancient date, from the discordant interests which divide the profession, and from the injurious influence of chartered monopolies, the task of medical reform, now in progress, will be as difficult as it is important; but no period for the attempt could be more appropriate than the present age of reason. Establishing and defining the grades of our profession, organizing or reforming colleges, limiting the chartered rights of corporations, planning curricula of education, and appointing disinterested boards of examiners for the ditlerent degrees of the profession, defining the privileges of universities and of private medical schools, establishing new subdivisions of medical science, defining the qualifications of teachers, the regulating of medical patronage, are subjects which will require much deliberation and inquiry, and in which the safety of the community, and the character of the medical profession, are alike interested. The ancient divisions of medical science, as commonly taught in the schools of England, are altogether inadequate to their present advanced state, and are incompatible with their being now efficiently taught, and this affects not only the existing schools and universities, but the regulations of all chartered companies, and the whole system of medical education. The inefficient manner in which the subjects of medical education are taught in our schools by the present system, is partly indicated by the remarkably absurd regulations of chartered companies, requiring students during the short period allotted to their academic studies, to attend several times the same course of lectures, as if several superficial courses on subjects of vast extent and importance, were equivalent to a full and detailed course given by a judicious subdivision of the subjects among distinct teachers; and these regulations emanate from those very bodies whose province it is to watch over medical education, and to take care that no course shall comprehend more than can be efficiently taught within the period prescribed for its duration. It is only in established universities that a full and comprehensive plan of education can be maintained or expected, for they alone, in all countries, are endowed with means to ensure permanent protection and talent for the higher and less common or lucrative departments of knowledge, and to secure that subdivision of labour which the extent of the sciences demands. These advantages cannot be established in a private school, where a single teacher is compelled to undertake several distinct departments, in order to afford him adequate remuneration, and where, consequently, these departments must be inefficiently taught. The privileges of chartered corporations may prove ruinous to the best interests of our profession, if not liberalized and watched by a just and impartial government; but if the corporation of apothecaries and the corporation of surgeons are the best fitted to plan their own curriculum, and to judge of the qualifications of their own candidates for these grades of the profession, why is the corporation of physicians alone, in these respects, a name without a reality? As it is obviously the interest of every teacher to circumscribe the curriculum as much as possible within the limits of his own department, it is as injudicious to leave to them the planning of that curriculum, as it is to make them also th« sole judges of the qualifications of their own pupils for the highest rank in the profession. If training the youthful mind to paths of usefulness, honour, virtue, and happiness, be the grand object of universities, it tends only to corruption to make them a mart for the traffic of distinctions, and a scene of mercenary contentions, however expedient it may be for the state to enrich them with the profits arising from the sale of honours. There can be no good reason, however, for London being behind Oxford and Cambridge in any advantages of this kind. The foundation of a great and liberal metropolitan University, like that of the sister kingdom, would be an undertaking of vast extent, and worthy of the present liberal and enlightened age, but walls and apparatus do not constitute a university, for they can neither teach the sciences nor ensure their being taught. Indeed, it is too obvious to require remark, that these are the last and not the first requisites of a university, which is founded on pillars, not of stone or of mortar, but of learning and genius. The University of Edinburgh, so long the Athenaeum of Europe, when in its glory, in the time of the Blacks, the Cullens, the Monros, the Gregorys, the Stewarts, the Playfairs, consisted, as some here may remember, chiefly of an unseemly aggregate of ancient cottages, where the light of genius shone brightest in obscurity and unadorned, and in proportion as its palace has risen, that University has sunk. Let us learn from experience, and let us hope that the period is not far distant when England will no longer stand alone among the nations of Europe, with its capital destitute of such a stable seminary, to extend the blessings of useful knowledge and polite learning to its vast population; and when that period shall arrive, the founders of this noble institution will see the object of their disinterested ambition realized, and will have the glory of having given the first impulse to an undertaking the most beneficial to their country and to mankind.
