
  GENTLEMEN,
  THE discoveries of science, though slowly comprehended and more slowly adopted, effect the most certain, and the most permanent revolutions in human affairs. Being necessary and eternal truths, founded on the constitution of the universe and of man, every established fact in philosophy, is welcomed by reason, as a new “law,” commanding respect and obedience; and it produces, inevitably, a universal influence in ameliorating the condition of the great community of mankind.
  The harmony of nature, and the happiness of beings capable of enjoyment, depend on the establishment of distinct “grades,” where the several ranks of existences are mutually connected and dependent; and where the existence, and the perfection of each separate “grade,” is essential to the well-being of the whole. The humble lichens spreading on the frozen soil of the poles, envy not the stately forests of tropical climes; nor do the arborescent corals rooted in the valleys of the ocean, envy the more gifted quadrupeds grazing on the verdant plains. The laws and “institutions” of nature are the types of our ideas of perfection and harmony, in which we are equally incapable of perceiving defect, or of conceiving improvement. But the “laws,” and “institutions” of human invention do not seek to rest their ephemeral existence on the immutable foundation of nature, or reason, but on temporary convenience or expediency. They are compacts founded on convention, where the assent may be yielded, without consulting reason, or even in opposition to her dictates. Being merely arrangements for a limited and determinate object, and resting on mutual consent, they partake more of the instability and fluctuation of the dogmas of faith, than of the eternal immutability of the ordinances of nature. In all civil “Institutions,” established by Charter, to effect some determinate object for the benefit of society, the consenting parties must preserve the compact sacred from the innovations of reason and the inroads of improvement. Those devoted to science and learning, must, therefore, ultimately, by the rapid advancement of knowledge around them, and the defined nature of their trust, become the conservatories of bigotry and ignorance, and preserve inviolate the integrity of error; and this necessary result of time, no human wisdom, or foresight can ever avert. In many, even which admit of a limited modification and improvement, but where advantages are monopolized, and privileges are secured, reason may, sometimes, dictate the necessity of change; but the weakness and vanity of human nature silence her timely admonitions; and honour, the faith of compact, the inviolability of the charter, are the convenient defenders of illiberality and misrule. As they constitute, however, part of the organization of the State, and were made for public, not private advantage, they must be preserved fit for their functions, or removed as morbid excrescences. The most effective and fundamental changes in a torpid constitution, are effected, not by spontaneous action, but by foreign agents, through the “primae viae,” which produce a healthful reaction to remove the distemper; or, by the weakness of the vis medicatria, induce the more violent, but more curative paroxysm of a radical Reform. Human knowledge everywhere advances with colossal strides; the wisdom of the philosopher is becoming the common sense of the vulgar. The unfettered Institutions of civil society make rapid progress in improvement; the light of science now illumines the path of the humblest avocations, and the universal race of man is up and stirring. The antiquated qualities which commanded admiration in the Institutions of ancient times, are no longer suited to the condition of mankind, and fail to procure even respect for their antiquity. The sanctity of their Charters and Statutes, and the exclusive character of their by-laws and policy, are barriers to their progress, and as they cannot advance, they must retrogade in the great tide of civil improvement. 
   
A large portion of human intellect has of late years been directed, with great success, to the advancement of every branch of Medical Science, and most of the Medical Institutions of our country are Chartered monopolies of great antiquity, which have served their time of usefulness, and have felt and avowed their insufficiency for the actual state and wants of our profession. As their objects and interests, however, are incompatible with, and directly opposed to each other, and their proposed changes are necessarily limited by the terms of their Charters, their plans of improvement have been restricted to alterations advantageous to their individual rights, rather than calculated to add new dignity to the character of the profession, or to unite its presentincongruous and repulsive elements. To aid and guide their ineffective efforts, therefore, the British Medical Association, with its numerous branches, has been formed, embracing members of every Corporate Institution, and nearly the entire medical community of these realms, with a responsible Council selected from and by the community, for their known honour, probity, and professional eminence, and headed by a President distinguished for his learning and skill, the most polite and conciliatory in his deportment, and the most consummate tactitian in Medical Politics. The propositions and resolutions of this Body, which, from its constitution, cannot be hostile or even neutral to the interests of the existing Corporations, but represents the whole as a whole, and not as consisting of isolated and irreconcilable parts, are regularly submitted to the judgment of the profession, with an account of its entire proceedings, through the public press, and especially through the LANCET, the great advocate of Medical Reform for the last twenty years. By the establishment of an Annual Oration on Medical Reform, an opportunity has been further afforded to individual members, selected from this vast association, of communicating their private views of the entire question, or an account of individual grievances as illustrations of some of its parts; and in endeavouring humbly to discharge the responsible duties of your honourable invitation, I shall consider first the character of our profession, and next the condition of its corporate institutions. Should I appear too charitable to the infirmities of our venerable Institutions, it is because I personally know that they contain men whose private virtues I shall ever admire, whose friendship I shall ever cherish and esteem, and whose generous efforts in the great cause for which we are assembled, merit the gratitude of their profession and of mankind. Should I appear to have formed an imperfect estimate of the learning and virtues of my professional brethren, it is because I have been long unwillingly torn from the pleasures and benefits of their instructive society, and the delightful impressions, once more vivid, begin to fade by distance of enjoyment. And should I appear to lean with too indulgent partiality, towards some particular “ grade” of the profession, this will not be ascribed to the selfish motive of its being mine; because I have long possessed the privileges of Apothecary (by means of the Edinburgh College of Surgeons' Diploma), Surgeon, Physician, Licentiate, and Fellow of a Royal College, though now prevented by the laws of my country, from even writing a prescription, to save a brother's life, or to support my own ; so that I am doubly neutral; first, in belonging alike to every “grade,” and next, in being alike excluded from all.
  IMPORTANCE AND ANTIQUITY OF MEDICINE.
  Learning and knowledge are not divine gifts, but articles obtainable by all at the expense of time and fortune ; and as they constitute the chief source and measure of power and greatness in individuals and States, and are beyond the unaided means of the community, a well-regulated State cheapens these articles, by supporting seats of learning for public use, and by affording judicious encouragement to useful knowledge. The rank and character of professions in a community are estimated by the same standard as those of nations on the globe, and a large portion of the current of human intellect, and of the revenues of all enlightened States, have been directed to the cultivation and advancement of the healing art. That this is due to the high character of its objects, and to the amount of knowledge and accomplishments required for their fulfilment, is apparent from the respect paid to it from the remotest antiquity, and from the early advanced state of this part of learning. The science and practice of medicine are founded on the actual constitution of things, as we discover them by observation or by reason, and not upon mere arrangements of human convention, like the legal, and other professions connected with civil institutions; nor upon the special dogmas of private faith, like the clerical ; hence its cultivators have been uniformly regarded as the chief depositaries of all practical wisdom, bearing on the temporal happiness of our species; and hence, also, the demonstrative evidence of its facts, and the mental culture, and the extensive knowledge of nature, acquired by its study. Our knowledge, acquired entirely through the senses, relates chiefly to physical nature and physical man, who, having the most complex and the most delicate structure, is the most liable to derangement and disease of all organised beings; and has, probably, first collected and generalized that kind of knowledge which most immediately related to self-preservation in health and disease. Among the ancient Egyptians, the Jews and the Greeks, the duties of religion and medicine were united in the same persons, as also with the magi of ancient Persia, and with the Brahmins at presentin India, and with missionaries and others among ruder tribes in our own times; so that a notion of something profound, occult, and mysterious has been constantly associated with the practice of our art, as attested by Moses, by Homer, and by most sacred and profane writers throughout antiquity. Hippocrates had extensive practice both as a surgeon and physician, about four hundred years before Christ, he lived to the age of ninety-eight, and wrote voluminous treatises on the most practical parts of surgery, as well as on the intellectual qualifications of medical men, and the most abstract parts of the theory of disease, which are still admired, and studied in all seats of learning. The writings of Aristotle are not less replete with most interesting facts in anatomy and physiology, and especially in comparative anatomy. The account which Herodotus has given of the practice of physic among the Egyptians, long before the time of Hippocrates, shows that at that remote period, medical practitioners formed one body, practised one art, were of equal rank, and distinguished by the same appellation, and yet had a greater sub-division of the profession than we have at present, each physician devoting himself exclusively to a particular class of diseases. “In these countries,” he says, “the art of physic is distributed into several distinct parts, and every physician applies himself wholly to the cure of one disease only, no man ever pretending to more, by which means all places abound with physicians; some professing to cure the eyes, others the head, the teeth, the stomach, and others the urinary and genital organs.” 
  The complicated refinements of civilization in the lapse of ages, have, of course, increased the wants and accidents, as well as the enjoyments of our species, and necessitated corresponding advancement in all parts of Medicine; and the practitioners of the healing art, by their increased learning, skill and usefulness, have continued to sustain their high rank and influence in the body politic. Indeed, the history of science shows that the members of our profession have contributed more to the advancement of human knowledge, than all the rest of mankind; and if they have seldom followed the paths of ambition in wars and politics, it is because the objects of their pursuits are different from, and of a more sublime character than the perishable institutions of men. If their achievements are less attractive of popular applause, they are more glorious in the permanent benefit they confer on weak and suffering humanity.
  SCHOLASTIC AND ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE.
  As the high station and influence he is to command in society, and his usefulness to the community, are to depend solely on his great intellectual attainments, his high moral worth, and his fitness for the responsible duties of his elevated calling, the future aspirant to medical fame is usually selected in early youth, in consequence of his manifesting, like our young Philarchus, a tendency rather to studious and contemplative habits, than to the more bustling activity of a military, a naval, or a commercial life. And as the greatest mark of affection which a parent can bestow, and the greatest fortune he can bequeath to a son, is a good education, our youth is carefully disciplined in all the elementary parts of polite learning, by which his dawning faculties are developed, and strengthened, and suitably directed to the pursuit of knowledge; and his physical frame is well practised in every elegant accomplishment and gymnastic exercise, which may develope its fair proportions, its graceful movements and healthful activity, to ensure that attractive address and pleasing exterior so conducive to his future success. But above all, by precept and example, he is betimes carefully trained, as was Philarchus, in the way that he should go, that he may never want an infallible Mentor, to guide him through the shoals and quicksands of his most perilous and tempestuous voyage. His scholastic and academic discipline in the dead and living languages, in the various branches of literature and philosophy, and in all the sciences which treat of the works of nature, continued to the age of sixteen or seventeen years, is as essential to his future greatness, as the study of the most practical professional subjects, for which they prepare his mind; and is as carefully insured in a proper curriculum of medical education. These earlier academic pursuits beget habits of study and close application, they teach his mind to think and to reason correctly, they exercise and improve the higher faculties of his nature, they develope a correct taste by habituating the mind to models of wisdom and virtue worthy of imitation, they give him access to stores of professional learning in the living and dead languages, they enrich his mind with the knowledge of the objects, the laws, and the harmony of nature, they open to him inexhaustible fountains of the purest intellectual enjoyment; and if they do not immediately prepare him to practise physic, they at least ensure him the conduct and character of a scholar and a gentleman, fitted to sustain the dignity of his high calling.
  To relieve him from the necessity of retaining on his mind all the elementary parts of this academic discipline, during the course of his more professional studies, and to insure his being fitted to commence these, he is now subjected to examination in the elements of classical learning, in the principles of the mathematical sciences and of natural philosophy, and in the first outlines of the various branches of natural history. And his proficiency in these essentials of a polite education, is attested by his Degree in Arts; without which, for the honour and respectability of our learned profession, no student should ever be permitted to approach even the threshold of the sanctuary of the healing art.
  PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION.
  The subjects of study forming the medical curriculum, divide themselves naturally into those which treat of healthy, natural, or normal condition,and those which consider abnormal condition or disease. The former of these embraces all the elementary, fundamental, and theoreticaldepartments, referring to healthy structure and function, and to the natural condition of all accessories concerned with the healing art. The second division comprehends all the practical branches, founded on the former, but relating to the nature and treatment of disease. And in a professional curriculum so extensive, and so varied in its objects, as that now required for an accomplished physician, it would greatly facilitate the student’s progress, to relieve his mind in the middle of his career, by examining him in the theoretical branches, and certifying his competency in these, before his entering on the higher and more immediately important practical studies; and this is now partially allowed in the University of Edinburgh.
  As CHEMISTRY stands in the same relation to medicine as NATURAL PHILOSOPHY, and as BoTANY has the same relations as ZooLogY, these subjects ought alike to form necessary branches of the general academic education, required for the Degree in Arts, rather than to be left to form parts of the professional curriculum.
  By DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY and PRACTICAL ANATOMY, the student becomes acquainted with the construction of the human body; and by SURGICAL ANAToMY, his attention is especially directed to all those parts most concerned in the operations of Surgery. But by GENERAL ANAToMY he is made acquainted with the intimate nature of all the materials or tissues, which enter into the construction of each part or organ; and by DEVELoPMENTAL ANATOMY he traces the first formation of every organ, and the phases through which it passes, from its embryo to its adult state. CoMPARATIvE ANATOMY, or Zootomy, traces the same organs through all their modifications in the Animal Kingdom; and Phytotomy or VEGETABLE ANATOMY exhibits their interesting forms throughout the lowest kingdom of organic beings. HUMAN PHYSIoLogY considers the body in a living state, and explains the uses or functions of every part; CoMPARATIVE, or animal PHYSIoLoGY examines the same vital phenomena throughout the animal creation; and VEGETABLE PHYSIoLoGY traces their interesting modifications in plants. MATERIA MEDICA is properly a branch of Natural History, and makes the student more intimately acquainted with the history of all those natural bodies employed as medicinal agents; by PHARMACY he is taught how to prepare them for administration; and THERAPEUTICs explains to him their various modes of action on the living frame. But in studying the properties of the various medicinal agents, forming the Materia Medica, and the complex theories of all the processes of Pharmacy, it is not meant that the medical practitioner shall engage in the commercial concerns of the trade in the former articles; nor that he shall interrupt his proper avocations by undertaking the sale of the articles manufactured by the latter; which are occupations quite incompatible with the due discharge of his professional duties, quite foreign and derogatory to his character, and highly injurious to the important concerns of the Apothecary. By the study of these various elementary and fundamental branches, connected with the normal condition of the body, and extending over a period of at least two years, he is prepared to enter upon that of the abnormal, and of all the more important practical branches, connected with the morbid conditions of parts. The invaluable researches of MoRBID ANATOMY make known to him the intimate changes in the textures of all the organs, which constitute the foundations of disease; and GENERAL PATHoLoGY explains the theory and the results of these morbid alterations. The THEORY and PRACTICE of SURGERY instruct him chiefly in the history and treatment of the more local disorders and external injuries, and especially such as require manual aid, or the use of instruments in their management, and the THEoRY and PRACTICE of MEDICINE consider rather the diseases which affect the entire system, or the more internal viscera, and commonly require the administration of internal remedies for their removal. As diseases, however, seldom occur singly, but most commonly blended together, and often superinducing or following each other, these distinctions are rather convenient and arbitrary, than natural or well defined, and could never serve as the foundation of distinct professions, or of distinct grades in the same. By due diligence in HospitALATTENDANCE, and by undertaking the discharge of the HospitAL DUTIES entrusted to the junior medical officers, and by means of the instructive practical courses of CLINICAL SURGERY and CLIN1cAL MEDICINE delivered in these establishments, a most intimate familiarity is acquired with all the practical details and minutiae of the management of the sick, which prepares him for the public duties of his profession, and enables him to dispense with many years of degrading, useless, and menial service, formerly exacted gratuitously under the title of “apprenticeships,” and with which indeed some of the Corporations still find it convenient to degrade the junior members of our profession. The study of MIDw1FERY and the DISEASEs of WoMEN and CHILDREN, opens to his view a vast field of most difficult and intricate inquiry, and of important practice, in reference to the continuance of the species; and by the departments of FoRENSIC MEDICINE and HYGIENE he is made acquainted with all the legal relations of the healing art, and with the art of preserving health; indeed, with all the higher relations of his profession to the community at large, to the health of cities, armies, fleets, and nations, and to the general welfare and happiness of mankind. And the separate and final examination in all these practical branches connected with disease, the study of which has extended over a period of at least three years, should terminate the Academic portion of his professional career, when his successful studies ought to be rewarded by his admission as a member of our profession, or of the Medical Faculty of this realm, with liberty to practise in which department, and in what place, taste or circumstances might determine.
  ACCESSORIES OF MEDICAL EDUCATION.
  Our young and zealous Philarchus had availed himself, however, of many accessory means of improvement, often omitted by less aspiring students. As an occasional visitor he had inspected all our principal hospitals, seen several operations performed by all our distinguished Surgeons, heard the most eminent lecturers on some of their favourite topics, and accompanied through the wards the most skilful of our physicians. In the hospital of his own Medical School, he had most assiduously, and most profitably fulfilled the duties of dresser, assistant and clerk, both to the Surgeon and to the Physician; he was familiar with all the most interesting Anatomical and Pathological specimens of our Metropolitan Museums; he was a leading member, and accounted both an orator and an oracle, in his juvenile Medical Society, where he had served on the different committees, and as secretary, and president. In most of the competitions in which he fearlessly engaged, he had proved successful, and was loaded with academic honours, medals, and fellowships; he had contributed many highly creditable essays to promote discussion in his youthful society; and although a strong bias towards the physical sciences is given by our medical studies, he still cultivated his early taste for classical literature, and was especially fond of the elevated diction, and the high sentiments of Cicero and Demosthenes. After concluding his studies, and receiving his Diploma, and taking a share of Dispensary practice, he visited leisurely. the principal Universities, Medical Schools and Hospitals of France, Germany, and Italy, and subsequently made a short classical tour on the continent, as physician to a nobleman, before returning finally to settle as a practitioner in this Metropolis. Such is the kind of mental and physical training, and such the kind of intellectual stores and accomplishments, with which the medical practitioner seeks to prepare himself, for maintaining his high and responsible position in society; and no profession calls more largely than his, for the constant exercise of all the higher virtues of our nature, as charity, benevolence, honour, and moral integrity. Considering the sacred responsibility of the practitioner in the treatment of every malady which can afflict the human frame, under every circumstance of climate, age, sex, or condition; viewing him as the arbiter of life, and death—and even of the character of his fellow-creatures, often under doubtful circumstances, or suspicion of murder, rape, or other capital offences; as intrusted with, the entire medical administration of all the Hospitals, Infirmaries, Asylums for the insane, and every other establishment for the sick, in all civilized countries; as individually responsible for the lives of the sick poor in extensive districts at home, and of entire countries of liberated slaves abroad; as the sole guardian of our race through the dangers of birth, and the perils of infancy, and as capable, by his professional skill, of snatching from death, or of restoring to reason a valued friend, a dear relative, an invaluable member of society, or a patriot, the hope and adoration of his country; regarding our professional brother, as capable, by his presence, by his profound knowledge and great practical skill, of inspiring with confidence conflicting hosts, and as the last source of hope, when choleras, fevers, plagues, and other pestilential epidemics threaten devastation to empires; considering, indeed, his almost sacred relations to human society, as the guardian of the being of our species, who soothes alike the entrance and the exit of this life of sorrow —this vale of tears; the first and the last friend of frail humanity; it is scarcely possible to conceive a moral agent in circumstances of more appalling responsibility, or impelled by stronger incentives to activity and usefulness, to the cultivation of his intellectual powers and resources, and, above all, to a life of beneficence, integrity, virtue, and honour; and no one ever felt this responsibility more sincerely, or more deeply than the moral, the virtuous, the learned, the accomplished Philarchus. Graced with every polite accomplishment of mind and person, which could endear him to society; a classical scholar of refined taste, and high moral feeling-enlarged in conception and in knowledge, by judicious continental travel; and cherishing the brothers of his profession as the brothers of his family; the type of a learned and skilful physician ; dignified without arrogance, polite without presumption, in the palace of the great; affable, generous, kind, beneficent, in the cottage of the poor; possessed of magnanimity to sacrifice a proferred Peerage, to his love for our noble profession; his youthful bosom glowed with the consciousness of possessing, and with the near prospect of exercising, his high powers of being useful to his fellow men ; and kindled with generous ambition to advance, as in his earlier successful career of honourable competition, to emulate in knowledge and usefulness the renowned seniors of his profession; to become distinguished among the illustrious members of some learned College, and to transmit his name to posterity among the benefactors of medical science; he entered one of the Medical Corporations, the College of Physicians of London.
  
  ADMINISTRATION OF MEDICAL AFFAIRS.
  As governments are formed and tolerated for the general good and welfare of the State, the only legitimate source of their power, is in the intelligence and will of the entire community. The community, indeed, may be said to transact its own affairs, through its representatives, over whom it therefore retains a certain degree of control. In all general questions affecting the spiritual or the temporal welfare of the mass of the nation, it is wise that the voice of this high and responsible tribunal should be heard. The institutions of religion, of national education, and of the public health, are hence among the principal objects of legislation, with all wise Governments.
  The great affairs of the Medical profession, such as the qualifications, the duties, the protection and the remuneration of Medical practitioners; the direction and support of Colleges and Schools of Medical instruction; the framing and superintendance of Medical curricula, and the examination of candidates; the regulation, the support, the patronage, and the Medical administration of all Hospitals, and other establishments for the sick; the objects and privileges of Medical Corporations, have too many important relations to the health and well-being of the community at large, to be neglected by any well-conducted Administration. Throughout France, Germany, Italy, Denmark, and most parts of Europe, the ordinances relating to Medical affairs belong entirely to the Legisla, ture; so that the qualifications, duties, privilegesrights, and immunities of Medical men are uniform, fixed and determinate throughout the entire extent of each realm; and these laws have the same high and responsible foundation as the other ordinances of the State. Even if we had not the experience of the working of an opposite system in other countries, we might anticipate that, in affairs which so much concern the public welfare, such a form of administration would be more likely to be generally satisfactory, and to ensure more uniform and beneficial results, than if they were left to the uncertain and varying caprice, or to the private interests, of inferior and contending parties in the State. National education among the French is regulated by the University of France, which is supported by, and responsible to the Government, through the Minister of Public Instruction; and has its subordinate colleges and other institutions in all parts of the empire, with about 5400 functionaries, chiefly instructors, salaried by the State. Every circumstance to the minutest details, connected with Medical education and government, is fixed by legislative decrees, like the other important affairs of the State. The Royal Academy of Sciences or Institute of France, the Faculty of Medicine of Paris, and the Museum of Natural History, consist of men salaried by government, who have each determinate duties, and represent every branch of literature, science, and the arts. They form a striking contrast with our country. In the Budget of the present year (1841), for instance, there are fifteen professors in the Museum of Natural History alone, with salaries of 5000 francs each ; and in the National Museum of Natural History of England, there never has been a single instructor, since the first foundation of the empire. In countries like ours, distinguished only for their commercial relations, it is not to be expected that the great and intricate questions of national education, the regulation of scientific institutions, or the complicated administration of Medical affairs, should be so easily comprehended, or their importance so readily appreciated, as those which relate to the more immediate necessaries of life, such as the exportation of manufactures, or the importation of corn. They can better comprehend the building of stables, than the conducting of national education or medical affairs. Indeed both the intricacy of the questions involved in medical government, and the apparently great national expense to be incurred by maintaining medical establishments throughout the empire, must be conceived to render their discussion little attractive either to an ignorant or penurious legislature. It is quite reasonable to expect, that such a government would rather be inclined to seek for a means of, and a convenient excuse for relieving itself from the responsibility of such undertakings, by handing them over to some other soliciting or willing parties in the State; and its regard and capacity for such matters, would be further illustrated by the selection which it made of the parties in whom to deposit this high trust. The complicated affairs of the medical profession are, of course, best understood by its practitioners, they are the most interested also in their due administration, and as they form a large and intelligent portion of the community, indeed a distinct and important community of themselves, they or their representatives obviously form the proper depository, if any, to receive such high trust and authority, yielded and delegated by government. As however there is but one government, and one code of laws for the entire community of each realm, it is but rational to expect, that the first consideration of a wise Legislature would have been, to insure the same unity of government and laws to the medical community, which is as distinctly a single aggregate as that of the State. What then shall we think of the legislation of our ancestors who devised, and of our present legislature which preserves a system of medical government, in the formation of which the medical community has never been consulted, in the constitution of which the medical community is no where represented, in the administration of which the interests of the medical community are insultingly trampled upon, without the power of appeal, and by the dismembered character of which the interests and powers of its own parts are hostile to, and destructive of each other. The charitable supposition might here naturally occur to any one, that in making a selection of a proper depository of this high administrative power, the government had preferred the three separate communities of Apothecaries, Surgeons and Physicians, into which the medical practitioners appeared to have divided themselves, to receive this important trust. So far from this being the case, however, the supposed separate communities of these three arbitrary and undefined divisions, have as little been consulted, or represented, or protected, or respected, or in any way considered, in this type of British extra-commercial legislation, as the single community of the entire profession. Was the legislature then deceived, and led into a belief that the parties offering themselves to administer the trust, were in truth the representatives of the medical communities 2 Not only was the legislature aware that the persons who had clubbed together, under these several designations, to become invested with authority to govern the medical profession, neither represented its entire community, nor any of these divisions of it; but by the Charters of Incorporation, and the power of self-election to all perpetuity which it granted to them severally, it has even carefully provided that they shall never become such representatives, and thus has deprived the Corporations of the power of ever reforming themselves. Had the governments of Egypt about the time of Cambyses, confessed an incapacity to legislate in affairs connected with the public health, and found it necessary therefore to seek for any small juntos willing to undertake them, among the physicians described by Herodotus, in the passage I have above cited, they would, also, from the divisions of Medical practice then in use, have established with equal propriety Colleges of Physicians of the Eyes, Colleges of Physicians of the Head, Colleges of Physicians of the Teeth, Colleges of Physicians of the Stomach, Colleges of Physicians of the Urinary and Genital Organs; and so of other parts—these independent and irresponsible medical legislatures having interests and privileges the most incompatible with, and the most destructive of each other, and obviously calculated to foment hostility and discord among all the parts of the dismembered profession. So deplorable an example of medical legislation, however, that wise people has left to posterity to realize. What then shall we think of the wisdom, the liberality, or the skill in such matters, of that legislature which, in our own time, has not only realized every absurdity of such a system of medical misgovernment, but has also repeated it in all its details, in three separate portions of the same realm, and with totally independent powers in each 7 And yet such is the Legislative tribunal which some of you expect to be able to comprehend, and to effect the reforms necessary to render the medical institutions of England of any value or utility to our profession, or to the community at large. The most iniquitous part of this iniquitous infringement of the rights of a large, respectable, and learned community, and indeed of the common rights of a free people, and that which entirely obstructs every inlet or prospect of improvement, is certainly the exclusive power of self-election in perpetuum, conceded by their Charters to these self-constituted, independent and irresponsible juntos, by which all remonstrances and just complaints from our injured profession, are most effectually stifled, and every protection, encouragement and incentive are wantonly afforded to devise and promote every kind of abuse and misrule; and the actual state of our Corporations shows the enormous extent to which the abuse and misrule thus encouraged, have at length arrived.
  OBJECTS OF MEDICAL CORPORATIONS.
  The ostensible object of the Legislature, however injudiciously that object may have been effected, in forming the Medical Corporations, has been merely to establish competent boards, to prevent unqualified persons from tampering with the public health; and to extend, by their By-laws, the qualifications of all persons, who are to practise the healing art. In return for the discharge of these duties, which a competent Legislature performs by Ordinances of the State, the Corporations are to receive and to dispose of the sums of money obtained by selling their respective diplomas, conveying certain local privileges of practice; which fund would otherwise have formed part of the public revenue. In conducting the sale, however, of their respective articles, privileges, rights, certificates or diplomas, as in the sale of poisonous drugs, all kinds of customers who may present themselves at the shop are not to be served or supplied blindly and indiscriminately, but are required to show a permit or Degree from some authorized University, or in the absence of this authorised permit, are to show themselves, by submitting to examination, qualified to buy and to use articles so capable of proving destructive to the public health. This appears to be the unsophisticated nature, and the sole object, of our various Companies of Apothecaries, Surgeons and Physicians throughout the realm, as indicated by the terms of the charters and statutes of their incorporation. The aspiring, the high minded, and ambitious Philarchus, accustomed to participate in the business transacted at the meetings of the Institute of France, the Academies of Berlin and Saint Petersburgh, and of our Royal Societies at home, soon found as much inanity in the proceedings as in the halls of his College. The all ingrossing questions of the By-laws, he had not yet learned to appreciate, the subject matter of the Annual Oration and the spectacle on the occasion appeared to him puerile, and his classical taste was generally more shocked with its Latinity, than ever he had been with the dangerous incongruities of the three pharmacopaeas of his realm, especially in reference to the most dangerous poisons. In looking a little into the records of his College, and observing the business and objects of its meetings, he was disappointed to find that instead of joining a great and learned Body, devoted to the cultivation and advancement of the science, the literature, and the art of medicine, he had rather become a partner in a kind of commercial firm possessing a patent or monopoly in a little article of traffic. Instead of having enrolled his name among the illustrious benefactors of human knowledge, he perceives that he has rather subscribed it to a bond or promise to support this concern, and to use his best endeavours to make it profitable to the partners of the firm. He had the sagacity to perceive that better varieties of the same article, were to be had at a cheaper rate, in two other rival firms, or Colleges of Physicians.
  The By-laws are properly but the conditions of the sale, and are continually fluctuating in all the Corporations, with the state of their market; but they are regulated so as to increase the sale and the price of the respective diplomas, without appearing so selfish as to endanger the Charter and the Corporation. Our accomplished youth, after several fruitless and most unacceptable efforts to liberalise the By-laws, to give a higher tone to the proceedings, and to conciliate the good wishes of the great community of his College and of the profession at large, began at length to yield to the great current in favour of supporting the Chartered Rights, and the dignity of a Corporation which had maintained its position for three hundred years; and indeed the occasional displays of his high talents, in questions of privilege, began already to indicate that peculiar bias or contamination, which the constitution and the concerns of our Medical Corporations, almost never fail to effect even on the purest minds.
  NEGLECT OF CORPORATIONS.
What motive can the venerable and worthy seniors of our Corporations have, to render the rising members of our profession, by extended curricula, more learned than themselves? Or, allowing them the virtue to disregard this self-degradation, what means have they of planning, or of enforcing the most complete and most effective system of intellectual and professional training for raising the character of our profession ? The most eminent men of our profession, either spurn connection with their Bodies, or are prevented from gaining admission into them by the exclusive restrictions of their By-laws. After spending the greater part of their valuable life in the service of their country, and in the arduous practice of surgery, in the army or navy, it is unreasonable to expect that the Council of the College of Surgeons, for example, should be the best acquainted with the extent of modern discovery in all the collateral branches of Medical science, or the best qualified to plan methods of study, or to conduct examinations in these subjects. Should any single Corporation adopt a curriculum, likely to produce accomplished youths, learned scholars, and skilful practitioners, they can neither enforce its adoption, by any other of the twenty independent examining and licencing Boards in this kingdom, nor prevent it from immediately stopping all sale of their own diplomas. Can the profession remove them from their places, prevent their reelection, stop their emoluments, or inflict other penalty upon them, for neglecting to raise its character and respectability, by improving and extending the curriculum, or for not risking an experiment of this kind which might prove fatal to their Corporation ? They are self-elected, irresponsible, hold their places for life, and scorn to notice the just remonstrances of their indignant brethren.
  Is it remarkable then, that the preliminary and professional education of our medical youths has been neglected by the Corporations, to which a most injudicious legislature had entrusted it? What course of preliminary education, calculated to prepare for commencing the medical curriculum, have they ever prescribed, to guide the affectionate parent or the industrious youth ? No person can become physician or surgeon in France or Italy who has not previously obtained a Degree in Arts as a sign of a polite education, and who has not also acquitted himself satisfactorily in extended Examinations conducted in Latin. The translation of a sentence from Gregory's Conspectus demanded by some of our Medical Corporations, as a test of a liberal education becoming our learned profession, is a poor measure of the attainments and intelligence of those appointed to legislate in such matters for the rising generation of practitioners.
UNIVERSITY OF LONDON.
  The responsibility for the expenses to be incurred, more than the complication of the details, is, with an ignorant and penurious Legislature, the great impediment to its taking any direction or concern in the affairs of national education or of the Medical profession. The ignorant may assert and the hypocrite may affect to believe, that the pleasures of science afford it sufficient support, and the pleasure of instructing sufficient return for its labour; but experience and common sense have long taught our Gallic neighbours, that although the price of knowledge be higher than of some other purchasable articles, there is some wisdom and policy in securing it, and that the philosopher ought as little to be expected to subsist upon fame, as those who become rich by his labours. Our shop-keeper legislature has at length arrived at the conception of a salaried Board connected with public education, and, although teaching no branch of human knowledge, has graced it with the deceptive name of the University of London, perhaps intended to pass for an imitation of the University or of the Institute of France. If the Treasury expenditure in behalf of knowledge, be the measure of the intelligence and power of a State, the metropolis of England will rank next to Tombouctou in the support of Universities, as it does also in their construction. By the first Charter of William IV, this Board, called the University of London, consisted of responsible members appointed, and to be appointed solely by the Crown, but by the second Charter of Victoria, it is constituted an irresponsible, self-electing junto, like the antiquated Corporations which have so long disgraced our country—and this, although the boon of a Whig ministry, and in the nineteenth century. Notwithstanding this odious constitution, where there is not even a confirmation of its elections left to the Legislature as there is in France, it has the great merit of producing a Medical curriculum the nearest to that of France, which turns to ridicule that of our antiquated Corporate juntos, and which promises to strike at the root of many of our professional grievances. It is only by the extension of education that we can ever hope to raise permanently the degraded character of our profession; it ever prepares the way for the acquisition and the enjoyment of rational liberty, it has reformed England, emancipated the negro race, and almost the Irish, and e'er long must sweep away the Chartered haunts of bigotry and misrule. It is the obvious interest, as it is the adopted system, of our Corporations, to check the growing intelligence of our professional brethren, over whom they desire to retain, as they already possess, unlimited control; and had our young Metropolitan Colossus, our new University, been born with a more healthful constitution, it might soon have overawed them like a Trojan Horse. The discernment of our generous youths, which impels them eagerly to seek the true honours of this young Institution, sufficiently attests that the distinctions most easily and most cheaply obtained, are not those most coveted, or best suited to the taste of the rising generation of practitioners. It has, however, not only neglected Comparative Anatomy as a branch of Medical Education, but has even concealed its principal details under the false title of “Animal Physiology,” for reasons not explained. This ignorance, or want of judgment, in regard to that brangh of science, is the more inexcusable, as it is already required both in the curriculum of our army and navy surgeons, and in some even of the smallest States of the continent, as in Denmark. It deserves our gratitude for directing attention to the important subjects of Pathological Anatomy and General Pathology, which have been most culpably overlooked by our Corporate Bodies, whose museums alone afforded effective means of teaching them; and whose authority alone could protect them, by enforcing their study by their Regulations. Our new Examining Board, or University, thas also judiciously copied the French school, in requiring the highly useful departments of Forensic , Medicine and Hygiene, and in this they have justly rebuked the neglect of the antiquated Corporations. But as an irresponsible Corporate junto, answerable neither to the Medical community nor to the State, their Medical curriculum, and their unprivileged titles, can only be considered as additions to the list of nuisances with which our profession is already oppressed. Although it commenced its career under the alluring and deceptive air of liberality and responsibility, as seen by its first Charter, every one acquainted with the penurious thrift of our shopkeeper Legislature in such matters, knew too well that a University in the metropolis of England, endowed and supported by the State, appointed by and responsible to the Crown, open to all religions and nations, and guided by liberal and tolerant views, was an undertaking far too well meant to be well executed, and far too great a sacrifice to knowledge to be of long duration in a country which has the intellect to maintain National Museums without a single instructor, Universities without a single Professor, Colleges without a single endowed Chair, endowed Colleges without a pupil, University Diplomas without a single privilege, twenty totally independent, irresponsible, rival, Medical-license shops, Hospitals, in the Medical appointments of which neither the Government nor t.e Medical community have any share, where edical surperintendence of the poor is sold by auction, where the titles of distinction conferred upon men of genius have nearly all been the rewards of foreign States, and where the most illustrious men, after pining in penury and neglect till aged and exhausted, occasionally receive a pittance, to save the national infamy of their dying in the Workhouse. It is only a cheap temporary device for a University, quite characteristic of the country which devised it, and it begins already to vacillate, and to retrograde, and to cater to the indolent, in those very departments which constituted its peculiarity and its excellence ; as in relinquishing its proposed examinations in Animal Physiology, in the Course of General Education. As every University in England, Scotland and Ireland, confers the privilege of practice along with its diploma of M.D., the illiberal conduct of our Legislature in withholding that privilege from the new University of London, is without a parallel in the whole past history of our realm. Had its Graduates been placed on the same footing with those of the other Chartered Universities, they would still have been compelled to purchase the right to practise in London from the College of Physicians, and that College would have been equally prohibited by its Charter and Statutes, from insulting these Graduates by subjecting them to re-examination. But, by its recent compact with the College of Physicians, for mu lal profit, to allow the Censors of the latter body to attend at the examination of Candidates for v. Degree of M.D., it obviously seeks to countenance, and connive at the arrogant interference of this College, with the rights of Graduates in other Universities. And the reward expected for this unworthy connivance, is the privilege of practice to be conferred by the College, on the Graduates of this new and unique specimen of an irresponsible Corporate junto, misnamed the University of London.
  GRADES OF MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS.
  As human structure and its derangements do not vary perceptibly with time or place, the perfection of the Healing Art, and the best means of acquiring it, must be one and uniform in all periods and in all regions; but differences, not existing in the nature of the objects, will arise from the state of human knowledge at determinate periods, and from the degrees of intelligence among different nations. As there are no natural grades in the Healing Art, the extent or nature of the curriculum to acquire it, proposed by different States, by different Corporations, or by different individuals, must be the measure of their intelligence, or mark the grade of their ignorance in this kind of knowledge. The Healing Art has been considered as one science and one art—undivided and indivisible in study or in practice, throughout all antiquity, as shown by the writings of Hippocrates, Galen, Celsus, and other Greek and Roman Physicians. During the short period of his life occupied with the professional curriculum, every part of the science and art of Medicine ought to be distinctly exhibited to the Student; and no part will be useless to him, whether he may afterwards prefer to confine himself to the external or the internal maladies, the manual or the prescriptive arts, or require to partake of both. The curriculum ought to be extensive and uniform—for all who aspire to practise any part of the Healing Art; , and whether the young practitioner shall prefer to be called Doctor of Medicine, or Doctor of Surgery, which names are both adopted in France; or Physician of the Head, or Physician of the Eyes, or of other parts, as among the ancient Egyptians; or Doctor of Medicine and of Surgery, as at present used in the University of Bern; will not be of any importance as to his rank in society, or his grade in the profession. His taste, his prospects, his opportunities, or other circumstances will best determine his selection of a future career; and the superiority of a brother practitioner will alone depend on superior knowledge or skill, which he will feel no degradation in acknowledging. In a profession pre-eminently distinguished for acts of charity, the proposition of establishing a grade of learned practitioners for the rich, and of ignorant for the poor, is revolting to humanity, especially as the privations to which the sick poor are necessarily subjected, demand for the treatment of their maladies, infinitely more skill and knowledge, than those which affect the rich surrounded with every comfort which affluence can secure. And the idea of leaving our brave countrymen, in the army and navy, so much exposed to accidents and maladies in all climates, entirely at the mercy of half-educated medical men, of an inferior and cheaper grade, is not less impolitic than it is repugnant to every charitable and benevolent feeling. The advantage and propriety of uniformity of rank, privilege, and education, among the members of our profession, are illustrated by the fact of a naval Surgeon being now Physician to our Queen; and the duties of his former isolated situation, no doubt, called as largely on his intellectual resources and practical skill, as his present situation surrounded with the best of every kind of professional assistance. Had the Art of Physic extended through organized nature, we might conceive natural grades, as Physicians of the Corals, Physicians of the Insects, Physicians of the Fishes, and other parts of the scale; but as applied to the curers of man's diseases, the proposal of forming grades appears absurd. The differences of physical constitution and mental capacity, of pecuniary resources and previous mental culture, of diligence in study and many similar circumstances, will always establish sufficient distinctions among the practitioners of every separate portion of the Healing Art, or of the whole, without the necessity of their contriving artificial means of degrading each other; and they are the only distinctions reconcileable to reason and to every liberal feeling. Where so many distinctions are established among the practitioners of the Healing Art, as at present in England, without actual differences of the objects they have in view, how is it possible to avoid continual infringements on the supposed rights and provinces of each other, and those painful collisions which so frequently disturb the peace and harmony of our professional brethren in their laborious avocations, and often to the serious injury of the sick intrusted to their charge?
  COMMERCE AND TRADE OF APOTHECARIES.
I cannot perceive what necessary connection is, or can be established between the commercial or the manufacturing concerns of the Chemists, Druggists and Apothecaries, and the duties of the Medical practitioner, by the mere circumstance of their articles being useful in the treatment of many diseases. Surely the Surgeon and the Accoucheur may employ their instruments as skilfully, without being also Cutlers; and the physician may prescribe his course of diet, without adopting also the profession of the Cook. Grocers, Bakers, and Butchers ought, on the same grounds as the commercial Apothecaries, to apply for a share of Medical practice, seeing that their articles of sale are not only necessary in all diseases, but are even essential to the maintainance of life during health. The complicated and important duties of furnishing the Materia Medica, and preparing the articles of Pharmacy, would surely be much more efficiently performed, as they are in France, by a body of intelligent men, freed from the distracting and fatiguing avocations of visiting the sick, and watching the progress of their maladies. These remarks have, of course, only a prospective view towards reforming the present chaotic state of the profession, and are not meant to encourage any retrospective unjust interference with the right of practice now possessed by the Apothecaries, who are at present Medical practitioners, as legally qualified as the Presidents of the Colleges of Surgeons and Physi cians, and who ought therefore to have the choice between the Practice of Medicine and the Commerce in Drugs. As this chaotic state of our profession has arisen not only from the gross abuses of the Charters and Statutes of the Corporations, through the medium of their By-laws, but also from the incongruous absurdities of the original construction of these Charters and Statutes, it is impossible, without the aid of the Legislature, that the Corporations themselves can effect even those improvements and reforms, which they desire to introduce into their own bodies. Every candid practitioner of the realm will accord with Dr. Kidd, that “if the united voice of nearly all the individuals who constitute the Medical profession, may be admitted as a just indication of the necessity for Reform, nothing more need be said in proof of the existence of that necessity; for that united voice is already raised in favour of the measure,” (Obs. on Med. Ref. p. 18). But as that measure has not yet been effected by Parliament, and that raised voice has not yet been listened to by the Legislature, it is perhaps wise, as it is obviously expedient, especially on this occasion, to agitate the measure till heard and accomplished, and to continue to urge its necessity by exhibiting the unsophisticated nature, the defects, and the abuses of our existing governing Corporations.
  COMPANIES OF APOTHECARIES.
  During the great Plague in this metropolis, in 1665, when the Fellows of the College of Physicians, as every one knows, scampered in all haste into the country, and left their dying patients to take care of themselves; so great was the demand for rhubarb and other medicines at the shops of the Grocer-apothecaries, who alone then sold them, and so useful did these officious men render themselves on that occasion, and also during the subsequent great Fire of London, that they were enabled to abandon the sale of their tea and sugar, and not only made fortunes by drugs alone, but supplanted the renegades in half their practice, and have since supplanted them in the other half. The atmosphere and the ocean are constantly undulating, and the solid crust of our globe has its constant waves; so do nations rise and sink, and waves of civilization illumine each part in succession, as Persia, Egypt, Greece, and Rome; and so of course do also the professions and avocations of men, according to the intellectual development of each region and period. Hence it has fallen to the lot of the philosopher in England to be supplanted by the artisan; the barbers supplanted the surgeons, by incorporation with them in the reign of Henry the Eighth; and our learned physicians, relaxing from want of superiors to supplant, and scheming pre-eminence in their own drug-testing club, have been very properly relieved from the troubles of attending the sick, by the sagacious apothecaries, who are now masters of physic and pharmacy in England and Wales. When the Apothecaries begin similar club machinations, it will be time for the Druggists to relieve them from their more arduous visiting and prescribing labours; the Druggists will be relieved by the Chemists, the Chemists by the Grocers, and these by the Quacks who it appears were formerly protected by distinct Acts of Parliament, as by that entitled, “A Bill that Persons being no common Surgeons, may minister Medicines notwithstanding the Statute,”.
  The London Apothecaries’ Companynotwithstanding the important and extensive duties of their members as practitioners of the Healing Art, have neglected all preliminary education excepting the usual translation of a Latin sentence: and in their limited curriculum they have entirely omitted all notice of General Pathology, the Principles and Practice of Surgery, Practical Chemistry, Clinical Medicine, Clinical Surgery, Pathological Anatomy, Comparative Anatomy and Hygiene; seeking thus, like the London College of Surgeons, to inundate the profession with persons as ignorantly or cheaply educated, as the Legislature or decency would permit. The waggish Apothecaries of Ireland appear to have had the classical ignorance of these two London Corporations especially in view, when they resolved that the first examination of their mere Apprentices, should contain among other objects, Latin trials in Caesar’s Commentaries, the Works of Sallust, the AEneid of Virgil, and the Satires and Epistles of Horace, and Greek examinations in the Iliad of Homer, the Dialogues of Lucian, and the Greek Testament; of which they are not merely to translate the language, but are to parse the original text. Surely the General Practitioners licenced by the Apothecaries to practise actually, though notnominally, Physic, Surgery and Pharmacy throughout England and Wales, deserve a better education and a higher title than are conceded to them by this Company, especially as the privileges of this Body now entirely supersede those of the London College of Physicians. As the Apothecaries are now legally qualified Medical Practitioners, it appears absurd as well as unjust Legislation, to grant them the advantages arising from the commerce and sale of drugs, and to exclude the Surgeons and Physicians from participating in the same privilege—a privilege, however, which it would be much better for all parties to separate, as it is on the continent, entirely from the duties of visiting and prescribing for the sick. The Apothecaries' Companies being comparatively recent dismemberments of the Grocers, as the Surgeons are of the Barbers, none of our old Chartered Universities form either of these Grades of practitioners, which are left to distinct Corporations. Although in England, Wales and Ireland the Apothecaries are now Companies distinct from the other grades of the .profession, their duties are united to those of the Surgeon in Scotland, where the diploma of the College of Surgeons authorizes to practise in both departments. And in the Charter of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, the Surgeons are described as Chirurgo-Pharmacopaci; the Apothecaries in England are, on the contrary, Medico-Pharmacopai ; but the Chemists and Druggists, as such, have no Chartered or legal right, in any part of the realm, to share in the duties of the Medical Practitioner, although often practising like other unqualified and unauthorized quacks.
  COLLEGES OF SURGEONS.
The barbers, who long preceded the Surgeons as a Corporation, having learned to draw teeth and to phlebotomise, began to prosper, and soon exchanged the sale of wigs for that of drugs, which the phlebotomists continue to sell in the modern Athens and throughout Scotland. In Dublin, Edinburgh and London small rival Companies of them, under the names of Colleges of Surgeons, thriving and incorporated, were enabled to fit up their back shop as a petit spectacle or Museum of Curiosities, to attract and divert customers, and promote their sale of Diplomas or Certificates, the staple commodities of all the Corporations. In the shop of Lincoln's Inn Fields, they ventured even on a higher flight, and attempted to explain the curiosities to spectators in public Lectures. But although this public exhibition was risked but for eight hours per annum, it was soon abandoned as far beyond their reach ; and the whole concern of the spectacle was handed over to the curator and his assistant. Still desirous however of attempting something to conceal their barber origin, and of appearing to countenance, if they could not support science, they announced the proposal, not less economical than thrifty, of hiring one medical student for £100 wages, to work for twelve months at the menial occupation of preparing curiosities for their exhibition. In Dublin and in Edinburgh they have been more conscious of their incapacity, and have better concealed their ignorance, by leaving the spectacle simply as such to posterity. * The self-elected twenty-one in Lincoln's Inn Fields, though authorized by Charter to stultify themselves by such mode of election, have acted for the last hundred years with little liberality and much less judgment, in continuing to claim as a worthless and offensive Chartered right, a distinction which the generous and discerning members of an enlightened profession, would have been eager to confer upon them, as a token of the highest honour and respect for past achievements, for superior talents, attainments, and virtues, and invaluable service rendered to their country. Irresponsible Chartered Corporations are the hotbeds for the development of all the higher vices of our nature, as indeed is partially seen in the history of Philarchus. And the late attempt of the College of Surgeons of London to control the Medical teachers, and thereby appropriate their gains, is a stain on their history. Their traffic in diplomas is increased by the common belief among students, that they are licences necessary to the practice of surgery; which however any one can undertake with as little legal interruption, without buying their article, provided they do not intend to enter the army or the navy. Irresponsible Corporations are but tolerated vices, and the least prominent holds the least dishonourable station. The College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, like their College of Physicians, shorn of the means of injuring, is virtuous by necessity; it is indeed but a charitable club of chirurgo-pharmacopaei, who deserve great praise for the liberal support they have always extended to their widow's fund, amounting to a fluctuating annuity of from £90 to £100 for each widow, and each Member of the College paying about six pounds per annum. The injurious influence of our irresponsible Corporations in retarding the progress of knowledge, is seen not only in their neglect of all the collateral sciences, which throw light on our profession; but also, and in an especial manner, in those professional branches which depend on them for encouragement and support. Looking to their authority and means of extending the curriculum, improving medical education, and giving effective instruction by their pathological and zootomical Museums, for example, it is impossible to conceive a greater impediment to the progress of Pathological and Comparative Anatomy in this country, than that presented by the ignorance or the neglect of the Colleges of Surgeons of London, Edinburgh, and Dublin. They have never attempted to introduce the smallest portion of these studies into Medical education. Their affected encouragements of Comparative Anatomy are much more calculated to insult than to promote that branch, and their Museums could not have been more useless for the diffusion of knowledge in the possession of the smallest private Medical Schools, than they have been in their custody. Indeed, they have been much worse than useless in their keeping, as they have proved the greatest discouragements and impediments to private enterprise; they have prevented the formation of such collections, and the introduction of this study in our Universities; and they have left to the Army and Navy Medical Boards, which do not possess such means of instruction, the merit of partially removing the stigma of ignorance in that department, to which this country has been so long subjected. The curriculum of the College of Surgeons of London, is much more worthy of their now separated partners, the barber-dentists, than of the enlightened Surgeons of the present day, omitting every allusion, not only to general elementary education, and to such collateral sciences as Botany, Zoology, and Comparative Anatomy, but even to such fundamental professional studies as General Pathology, Pathological Anatomy, Hygiene, Clinical Surgery, and Clinical Medicine. The chief object, indeed, which the Council of this College appear to have aimed at, is that of forcing the students to fee the Hospitals of which they are the Surgeons, and to spend the most valuable years of their life in the idle and unprofitable habit of promenading their wards; for which idle relaxation they have insured sufficient leisure, by the shortness and inanity of their curriculum of professional and general studies. Is it reasonable to suppose, that abuses so seriously affecting the character, as well as the interests of our profession, together with the innumerable grievances with which the public journals have so long teemed, could have been tolerated to the present period, had the governing Councils of these Colleges been responsible, either to the Medical community, or to the Government of the State? The last and sole Charter possessed by the College of Surgeons of London has never been confirmed by Parliament, so that that Body has neither legal privilege nor existence in the State.
  RIGHTS OF UNIVERSITY GRADUATES.
Without meaning to justify the system, I may state the fact, that the Chartered Universities of this realm have enjoyed in time past, and do now enjoy, the privilege, not only of teaching the various branches of Medical Science, but of testing by examinations, and testifying by Diplomas, as to knowledge acquired. These privileges alike exist and have existed from a remote period, in England, Scotland, and in Ireland; and the Diplomas conferred on Graduates in Medicine, are always accompanied, as they likewise distinctly express, with the right to practise as Physicians. The art of Surgery, being in its first origin a dismemberment of the more ancient art of Barbery, the old Universities have not contemplated the formation of that now important and distinct class of Medical practitioners. The Corporations of Surgeons being modern branches, detached from those of the barbers, the formation and the concerns of that grade of practitioners are still left entirely to these recent Corporations, and our universities do not recognise this relatively new sub-division of Medicine, or confer the title of Surgeon. The same applies to Apothecaries. The Corporations or Colleges of Physicians, neither by their constitution, nor by the objects of their foundation, nor by their charters, nor by the statutes which confirm these, were ever designed to partake of an Academic character, or to share in any of the functions assigned to Universities. They are purely judiciary tribunals, and their privileges are entirely local. They consist of a community of Fellows, with a President and Council, or Elects, as they are termed in the London College, and there are no other kinds of Members recognised by the Charters or Statutes of these Corporations. They were never contemplated either to teach, or to examine, or to testify as to the competency in knowledge of the Graduates of this realm. The College of Physicians of Edinburgh is prohibited by Charter from teaching any branch of Medical Science. They consist of an incorporation of Physicians alone. That of Edinburgh is prohibited, by several clauses of its Charter, from examining Graduates; and that of London has the same prohibition by the statutes of Henry VIII, its Charter making no reference whatever to the mode of admission into its body. As mere judiciary Corporations, their objects, specified and implied, were to examine the authenticity of Diplomas and other documents, to grant local privileges of practice to Physicians, to confer certain rights and immunities, to protect the Public from false pretenders and unauthorised practitioners, to prevent irregularities of practice, and as an especial and specified object of their formation, to test the qualities, and to watch over the condition of all substances sold as medicines by the Apothecaries, and to destroy such drugs as were found unfit to be administered as remedies in disease. These immunities of Graduates in Medicine are attested by the rights and usages of Universities, as well as by the Charters and Statutes of the Corporations of Physicians. Before the Union of Scotland and England under the same Crown, the Graduates of either country were, of course, foreigners in the other; but since that period, the rights are legally, as well as justly, common to the two countries; and they have always been recognised as such by the College of Physicians of Edinburgh. All By-laws devised by individual Corporations, which violate the sanctity of these rights of Graduates, although they may be tacitly connived at, or ineffectually resisted by Universities are nefarious infringements on the privileges of Graduates, and of the medical and general community, which an impartial and vigilant Legislature is bound to correct and to punish. Indeed the passing of a By-law, by any College, for the purpose of private gain, to enforce physicians to pay twice for the same title, rank, privilege, or kind of examination, or to pay for the same object or privilege in two separate bodies; or for the purpose of nullifying by rejection, a right legally obtained from another board, would be a public fraud which could not escape punishment from a competent and just Legislature, although it might well suit the secret machinations of an irresponsible junto to attempt it. In a learned profession like that of Medicine, it is natural to expect that the members of such an irresponsible Corporate clique, some of them teachers, and all of them University Graduates, should feel little inclined to rest satisfied with their mere judiciary character, alone conferred by their Charter and Statutes, and should desire to share, or at least to appear to share, in the higher academic functions of the Universities, though never contemplated in their formation. But as “ men possessed of an uncontrolled discretionary power, leading to the aggrandizement and profit of their own body, have always abused it,” we soon find ... them usurping the privilege of instituting examinations into the competency in professional knowledge, as well as into the authenticity of the Diplomas, of legally qualified practitioners. This infringement of the rights of Universities was early commenced, and is now carried to a great extent by the College of Physicians of London, and has given rise to continual litigations with that Body almost from its first formation. “By what fatality it has happened,” said Lord Kenyon in 1796, “that almost ever since this Charter (of the College of Physicians of London) was granted, this learned Body have been in a state of litigation I know not,” (see Coll. of Phy. v. Dr. Stanger). Any medical man who had looked even cursorily into the public documents connected with the privileges and objects of this College, could easily have shown his Lordship that the great cause of this fatality lay in the superficial, perverted, and ignorant views, which he and some others, of his legal predecessors, had taken of the various persecutions instituted by that Body against the legally qualified practitioners of this realm; and in their constant endeavours to rest the merits of these questions on the trashy consideration of the By-laws, arbitrarily formed by the College, instead of inquiring into the vested rights conferred o that Body by its Charter and Statutes. By this encroachment on the rights of Universities, the College of Physicians of London has obviously imputed to them an incapacity either to teach or to judge of Medical attainments, or it has imputed to the Graduates the forgery of their Diplomas, which are the only legal testimonials of their competency recognized by the Statutes of this realm. This arrogated privilege, base in its origin, has been much more base in its subsequent employment to crush medical dissenters, or Scotch Graduates, by excluding them from the College; and to forward the interests of the English Church, or Graduates of Oxford and Cambridge, by admitting them alone to the advantages of the Fellowship. “The distinction,” says my acute predecessor, Dr. Hall, “made between the Fellows and the Licentiates, is in reality a religious distinction. Why are the Graduates of Edinburgh excluded from the Fellowship whilst those of Dublin are admitted to it? The “fons et origo” of this distinction are these—the University of Dublin is episcopal, that of Edinburgh presbyterian; the Graduates of the former are, therefore, admitted at Oxford and Cambridge “ad eundum,” and, therefore, to the Fellowship of the College of Physicians; the Graduates of the latter are not l” (Hall's Orat., p. 8.) Indeed, so great an insult to the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, as that of re-examining the competency of their Graduates, against which all the Statutes of Henry VIII had given the most strict injunctions, and which is not sanctioned or countenanced by any subsequent Statutes, could not have been connived at, without the inducement of the prospective advantage thence to be derived to the English church; and this understanding between all the parties, is sufficiently apparent from the details of Dr. Winterton’s letter from Cambridge to the President of the College of Physicians of London, in 1635. These encroachments on the rights of University Diplomatists, have been greatly encouraged by the supineness or incompetency of our Legislatures; and have now almost rendered the granting of such Diplomas, conveying privilege of practice, a public fraud. The incompetency of our Legislators to judge in questions relating to medical privileges and qualifications has been often displayed, as by their selection of the Bishop of London and the Dean of Saint Pauls aided by four medical practitioners, as the most appropriate tribunal for the examination, the approval and the admission of the members of our profession, to practise physic and surgery in the metropolis of England. They permitted the College of Physicians to imprison Dr. Bonham, a distinguished physician and a Graduate of Cambridge, in 1610, for practising in London, and declining to submit to their arbitrary, illegal, and insulting ordeal. They permit the College of Physicians to designate, by the reproachful and insulting epithet of Licentiates, the most learned and able members of that Body, and arbitrarily to exclude them from their Chartered rights of Fellowship. They permit the College of Physicians at present, arbitrarily to compel its candidates, to dispossess themselves of their previously purchased privileges, as Members of the Apothecaries’ Company; and also to dispossess themselves of those acquired, by becoming Members of the College of Surgeons. They permitted the College of Physicians arbitrarily to restrict the number of its Fellows to twenty, by a By-law which was pronounced by Lord Mansfield to be “illegal.” Oxford, indeed, obligingly handed over the public examination of its graduates entirely to the London College of Physicians, till repeatedly and severely reprimanded by Lord Stowell, when at length that University found it both expedient and safe to return to its duty, as shown by their distinguished Professor Dr. Kidd, whose candid criticism of many abuses, merits the gratitude of his profession. That learned Physician, however, is not quite correct in supposing that the question of Medical Reform, has ever been agitated with the community of English practitioners, in consequence of “the difficulty of admission to the Fellowship of the College of Physicians.” It is notorious that the mass of medical knowledge and skill, has always been confined to the misnamed Licentiates, and that every difficulty, in a fair and honest competition with the favoured few, they would have been the first to surmount. The dissatisfaction and the disgust of the Licentiates has always arisen from the unfairness of the competition, the partiality and injustice by which they were prevented from showing how much more qualified they were to overcome all honourable difficulties of admission, than those graduates of those most defective Medical schools, Oxford and Cambridge, whom the College had arbitrarily determined alone to receive into the Fellowship. Dr. Wells, says, “the three physicians, who to my poor apprehension have appeared to have the weakest understandings and the smallest extent of knowledge, of all those with whom I have happened to converse, either in this or any other country, are Fellows of the College (of Physicians) of London,” (Letter to Lord Kenyon p. 330); and this must always be their character, while their By-laws prevent learning, knowledge, genius, and skill from having any concern with their elections. Indeed the encroachments of this drug-testing Corporation on the Chartered rights of our ancient Universities, are now. become SO ludicrously extravagant, and their By-laws are now so totally at variance with their Chartered privileges, that the profession is bound to demand of the Legislature, as an act of common justice and honesty, either to rob our venerated Universities of their long enjoyed right, to grant Medical Diplomas and Privileges of Practice, or to cause the Corporation of Physicians of London to return to their original judiciary functions of examining drugs, and documents, and quacks, and selling their privilege, as limited and prescribed by their Charter and Statutes, or to wipe away one of the greatest nuisances which has ever disgraced a learned profession. Our aspiring Philarchus, advanced by his distinguished talents and accomplishments, overwhelmed with practice, rising in influence and wealth, courted by the great, rising in royal favour, and with little leisure to add to the stock of his knowledge, or to enjoy either science, literature or the arts; but cherishing a great interest in the affairs and prosperity of his College, where he ever found an agreeable relaxation from professional fatigues, in the society of a select few, who appeared duly to appreciate and to acknowledge his merits, now takes a leading part in all discussions connected with rights and privileges, and begins to look forward to the highest rank in that body, as the climax of his intellectual ambition. Having long ceased to disturb the harmony of the meetings by obtruding his high notions, and liberal sentiments, and high moral feelings, touching the exclusion of nearly the entire community of Fellows, and the degrading change of their title; having a thorough knowledge of all by-laws and documents connected with the proceedings, and rights, and usages of the Corporation, and great tact in their application, he feels the pleasure of a new species of greatness in the ascendency he now commands over the minds of his fellow members; and in all discussions he aims rather at gaining consent than conviction, rather at expediency than justice, and at victory rather than truth. Seeing the slavish apathy of the great mass of his professional brethren, as to their humiliated condition, he begins to look down upon them, and rather to desire their further separation from his College, than their closer incorporation, and more liberal participation of its advantages. Observing that by the ingenious contrivance of “examinations,” the members of his college had been converted into a kind of Toads, exhibiting all the grades, phases, and metamorphoses of amphibious animals, in the forms of Licentiates, Members, Candidates, Fellows, Censors, Elects, &c., and that their dexterous employment had succeeded in converting the Corporation into a kind of aristocratic high Church Establishment, he resolved to try on some future day, when he should hold the highest rank in the College, whether the extension of the same successful contrivance might not convert it into a University, to grant diplomas, make physicians, and even teach the various branches of the Healin He entertained a low opinion of the SurgeonCorporations, as a kind of barbe hanics, without either classical or scheming heads, authoritative by Charter and not by the merit of ingenuity, like his College, and apparently slumbering contented with the mere enjoyment of money, which never yet was an object of ambition with Philarchus, though liberally thrust upon him. He resolved to profit by the observation of their clever mode of silencing blustering renegades, by admission; but he found no intellect displayed in their mode of humiliating their Licentiates, by ordering them out by a back door of their College. Although his fine moral feelings had been much blunted by his ambition for temporal greatness, and by the polish of high life, he could not tolerate any open displays of immorality, and severely censured the Apothecaries of Dublin, for giving the Greek Testament, as a parsing book for testing their apprentices, in preference to the Philippics of Demosthenes. From the innumerable compliments and douceurs, however, which he had received through the influence of the Apothecaries, especially at his first outset in practice, he never failed to treat them with the greatest respect throughout his prosperous career, or at least with an enforced ceremony which with him had now become quite equivalent. No act of charity is even now permitted to interrupt the busy routine of his professional avocations, nor act of generosity ever proceeds from genuine impulse but from the desire of display and effect, and as all friendship has given way to expediency, so has the advantage of friends given way to the enjoyment of flatterers. And although it is hoped that every leading member of our irresponsible Corporations, must see in Philarchus, his own image, he must be a fool who flatters himself that he alone has here been honoured with a special notice.
  ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS OF EDINBURGH.
  Although the Medical Corporations or selfelecting irresponsible clubs, are always formed to gratify the petty vanity, or worse motives, of a few soliciting individuals, commonly medical attendants to the Crown for the time being, some specious public grounds are always sought for, to excuse or justify their Charters passing the Legislature. The pretexts set forth for thus yielding to the solicitations of Linacre, Chambre, and a few others to have themselves constituted into a College of Physicians in London, and to the requests of Hay, Crawford, Pitcairne, and some others to be erected into a College of Physicians in Edinburgh, were the urgent necessity of checking the frequent adulterations of drugs by Grocers and Apothecaries, and of putting some restraint on the mal-practice of “common Artificers, as Smiths, Weavers, and women (who) boldly and accustomably took upon them great cures, &c.” (3. Hen. VIII. c. 11) as stated in the Statutes and Charters of these Bodies. The duties of examining these weavers and women-quacks, had previously been performed by the Bishop of London and the Dean of St. Pauls, in the presence of some medical men; and in the Charter of the College of Physicians of Edinburgh, they are said to have even assumed the title of Doctors in Physic, when they could neither read nor write. The Charters of Incorporation, and the Acts of Parliament relating to these Bodies, are therefore chiefly occupied with details as to the mode of examining and punishing these unqualified persons, and as to the mode of proceeding in the examination and the destruction of the noxious drugs found in the shops. Before the reign of Charles the Second, the Legislature, however, appear to have been well acquainted with the arrogant abuse of its authority by the College of Physicians of London, and its constant desire and successful efforts to interfere with the privileged rights of the Universities, by subjecting their graduates to re-examination, as to their competency in the elements of professional knowledge. As these abuses had arisen chiefly from the brevity and vagueness of the old English Charter, much greater care was taken to arrive at precision, and much more honesty was displayed, in framing the Scotch Charter, granted by that Monarch in 1681, to the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. By this Charter, which expatiates on the necessity of properly educated persons practising the legal and other professions, and on the hoards of uneducated quacks who practised and vended Medicine without any restraint, several practitioners being “Artium Majistres” and “Medicinae Doctores” are associated into a College, Society, or Incorporation of Physicians, to superintend the practice of Medicine within the town and suburbs of Edinburgh, and “to prevent any one from practising within these limits without having a warrant and diploma, (warranto etdiplomata) to that effect, granted by the President and College.” It is ordained that, annually, two of the Fellows, as Censors, shall, along with the President, call the offending unlicensed practitioners before them and fine them; but they are not to fine a “pharmaco-chirurgus,” unless one of the town bailies be present at the trial. They are especially to examine the condition of the various drugs sold in the Apothecaries’ shops, and are, with the authority of the magistrates, to throw out into the public streets, and utterly to destroy all such as are found to be corrupt, and unfit for administration to the sick. It is particularly provided, that the privileges of the College shall in no way extend to the erection of Schools of Medicine, or for the teaching of any part of it, or to the granting or conferring any Degrees relating to it; and they shall in no way interfere with the rights and privileges granted in favour of the Universities of St. Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh. The Graduates of these Universities shall have power and liberty to practise in the said city and suburbs, without molestation or fine, unless they come to reside in some part of the city; in which case they shall be subjected to the laws and regulations of the College like the other Fellows. And the said College of Physicians is hereby obli-ged to grant license to any one or more Gra-duates of the Universities, without previous or antecedent examination, but solely on producing their Diploma or admission to the degree, to the President of the College, (absoue quovis praevio seu antecedente examine, sedsolummodo ad ipsorum diplomatis, seu ad gradus admissionis Presidi dicti Medicorum Collegii productionem licentiare). Masters of Arts practising Medicine, and Graduates of celebrated Foreign Universities, are also to be immediately admitted to the same privileges without previous examination (nullo praeeunte examine). Such are the simple privileges granted to the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh by a Royal Charter of 1681, which is now a libel on the past history of that illustrious body, which, by having no room left for schemes of low ambition, or vexatious usurpation, has done more to advance Medical Science than all the other Medical Corporations of the realm; and many of its brightest ornaments, by removing to this metropolis, have contributed to illumine the dark annals of its senior but unnatural brother. Having never insulted any “established University” at home, or any “celebrated University” abroad, by implying its incapacity to teach and to examine, or by questioning the propriety or authority of its diploma, nor having ever had the indecency of imputing to a Graduate, by implication, the forgery of his University Diploma, it has continued from the beginning its unsullied and illustrious career, purely as a Society or College of Physicians; and having given no room for envy, jealousy, or detraction, it has commanded the respect of its community and of honourable men, and conciliated the best wishes of the profession. Instead of cautiously withholding its Charter and By-laws from public inspection, with a view to the concealment of a system of usurpation, in direct violation of its obvious intentions, and of the most iniquitous system of By-laws that ever disgraced a Corporation, as is done in London, it presents a copy, both of its Charter, and its simple code of By-laws, to every Fellow on entering; and has sought to found its greatness, not on a complicated and vacillating system of chicanery and oppression, but on the more solid pillars of learning and justice. Need I recal to you the illustrious names of its Blacks, its Cullens, and Monros; its Pringles, Pitcairnes, and Porterfields; its Rutherfords, Homes, and Browns; its Murrays, Hopes, Barclays, and Gregories; its M'Gregors, Duncans, and Hamiltons; and the long line of their distinguished successors who continue to support its fame? What branch in the whole range of Medical Science, even to the recent branches of Medical Jurisprudence, and Comparative Anatomy, have not the individual enterprize and zeal of its Members contributed to advance? It has flourished in amity for a hundred and sixty years, and given to the University of Edinburgh its brightest ornaments ; all the Medical Professors of which are Fellows of the College of Physicians. Yet is even the President of this learned body, before he is permitted to receive his license to practise in this metropolis, by a By-law of the College of Physicians of London, unsupported by a single clause of their Charter, distinctly at variance with its intention, and directly in violation of all the Statutes which confirm it, and contrary to the Chartered privileges of our University Diplomatists, since the Union of Scotland and England under the same Crown—required to disgrace his College, by submitting to the arbitrary, illegal, and ignominious ordeal of a re-examination, as to his competency in the first elements of his profession. The privileges and immunities of the College of Physicians of Edinburgh are identical, in almost every point with those of the London College, as indicated by the comparison of the various clauses of their Charters and Statutes. But the Edinburgh College has honestly kept, throughout its long career, within the simple interpretation of its Chartered rights; while the London College has perverted and violated every clause of its Charter and Statutes. The Edinburgh College has commanded respect, by personifying the history of a well qualified but unassuming practitioner, or a philosopher capable of conceiving and achieving true greatness; while that of London is an object of universal contempt by its continued personification of an arrogant, insolent, ignorant, and presumptuous quack. And as every candid observer admits that the most distinguished Physicians of England are almost always the injured and degraded Licentiates of the London College, who have been educated at the University of Edinburgh, all the Medical Professors of which are Fellows of the Edinburgh College of Physicians, it is obvious, that the chief light of Medical Science and skill in England, and any eclat which the London College may have acquired, have been derived from the same northern luminary, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. Whose talents and learning, for example, are to add to the glorification of the London College this season, in the Gulstonian Lectures? Those of our illustrious colleague, Dr. Marshall Hall, a Graduate of the University of Edinburgh, and formerly lecturer in that city, where I was his pupil in 1813. The ambitious Philarchus, now physician to a great Monarch, President of his College, swaying its deliberations by his superior talents, the constant associate of Royalty, solicited to accept a Peerage, a Croesus in wealth, and possessor of every honour he esteemed worthy of ambition in this life, yet instinctively impelled by acquisitiveness to some higher yet unknown greatness, contemplates the great design of further aggrandizement by raising his College above all other seats of learning in this or perhaps in any nation. Although he feeds on the fawning adulation of interested flatterers, he views his humbler professional brethren as the very dregs of society, and seeks every means of elevating the rank and eclat of his College, by estranging them and degrading them in the estimation of the public. His soul being concentrated in the College, there is no comparison in his mind between reigning there, and serving as a cypher among the Peers or the Ministers of any realm. Having by the successful, though illegal contrivance of grades and “examinations,” converted the College into a kind of ladder, leading from the canaille of Licentiates, by a long winding course, to his own high station; he conceived the happy thought of applying the same scale, to classify the organs of the human body. Anatomists consider the rectum anduterus as pelvic, contiguous organs, developed from the same cloacal portion of the alimentary canal; but Philarchus discovered the former to be of a totally distinct, and much higher grade than the latter. And although his own autopsis had long been limited to the contents of the former cavity, he declared the Acoucheurs to be unworthy of a seat in his College, because they concerned themselves with the contents of the latter organ. He did not object to the Act authorizing the Apothecaries to share with his College in the duty of testing drugs, because it enabled him to-keep the advantages, or throw off the obloquy, of that dirty concern, as occasion might need. Knowing well that the antiquated Charter and Statutes of the College, were a libel on the fantastic mummery of its present construction and proceedings, he prohibited all access or reference to such opprobrious documents, and admired the clever cunning and the ingenious hypocrisy of the legal authorities, in founding all their decisions respecting the persecuted Licentiates, on the immaculate and the immutable Code of By-laws. The sober, industrious, slow moving, humble, but honest and honourable brother-College at Edinburgh, was an eye-sore and a reproof, which he could never calmly tolerate to hear even named; and when praised for its virtue and science, he had the baseness to insinuate that this successful rival, though younger brother, is a foreigner, and would be treated as such should it ever presume to obtrude itself within his walls. The uniform rudeness of the Scotch Graduates, in simpering at his Latin rhapsodies, on the occasion of the Annual spectacle, increased his dislike to the Northern University, were the long, austere training produced characters so much more censorious, than the gay, aristocratic dissipations of Oxford and Cambridge. All the higher principles of his nature had now been polished so thin, that he was flexible as an eel in and on every point, which enabled him conveniently to yield to every external pressure, and he communicated the same pliant character to the By-laws, so that on one day they threatened persecution and extermination to the Licentiates, and on the next they were welcomed with open arms. Imboldened by successful intrigue, he discovers that all wisdom is vanity, that although the members of his profession may know something of nature, they know nothing of the world; and he soon convinces them that in the original of the book of job, authority is granted to his College, by implication, to found seats of learning, to teach all knowledge, and to confer all distinctions, honours, and privileges, in science, literature and arts. This important discovery, respecting the drug-testing Corporation, was soon after publicly announced for the edification of mankind. But this becoming the subject of universal derision, a shelter from ridicule was sought in a more humble connection with a fit brother of his College, the University of London.
  Some who had been willing to think Philarchus a philosopher, now began to view him as a fool, and observing more closely his arguments and schemes, found them shallow and selfish, and that he suppressed the Charter and Statutes because the By-laws were an ingenious lie from beginning to end. Although he still commanded a clique, who found it convenient to command him, the more intelligent members would no longer countenance the trick, or lend themselves to his glorification; the Meetings became deserted, the invited declined, the solicited rejected, and being a man of straw he had no resources to rally.
  COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS OF LONDON.
  The corporation of Physicians of London was constituted in 1518, by Letters Patent of Henry
VIII, for the glorification of his favourite physician Linacre, who made himself president for life, and held its meetings in his private dwelling in Knight Rider Street. The objects of this College are chiefly detailed in the Statute of Henry VIII, (32. Hen. 8. c. 40.), consisting of three clauses, by one of which they are authorized to practise Surgery, as a branch of Physic, throughout the realm; by another they have the usual exemption from keeping watch and ward; and by the principal clause are explained the modes of procedure to be adopted, in searching, viewing, and seeing the Apothecary wares, drugs and stuffs, and in burning and destroying such as they “shall find defective, corrupted, and not meet, nor convenient to be ministered in any medicines, for the health of man’s body.” The only direct attempt to grant this College the power of insulting the privileges of University Graduates, is contained in a Letter from Charles II, in 1674, to the College, so dictatorial in its style, so expressive of ignorance regarding previous Statutes of the realm, so illegal in regard to the acknowledged privileges of Universities, and so bigoted and unjust, that it was never confirmed or countenanced by the Legislature, or made Law by Act of Parliament. This stupid and illegal private compliment to the College, had it received the necessary confirmation of Parliament, would have converted that Body into a mere tool of a high Church party, would have repealed all the previous Statutes granting the Universities the power of examining and licencing Graduates, and would have been quite incompatible with the present rights of promiscuous admission claimed by the College itself. One of its liberal provisions ran thus:—“We direct you not to admit any person whatever as a Fellow of the Society, and to enjoy the privileges of our said College that hath not had his education in either of our Universities of Oxford or Cambridge, kept his Act for Doctor in Physic, and done his exercises accordingly, or that is not incorporated and licenced there, having first taken the oaths of allegiance and supremacy, &c.” Before the College of Physicians of London was founded we find in the Statute (9 Hen. V.) of Henry V, the following clause, acknowledging the right of Chartered Universities to grant privilege of practice, “that they, the which be able to practise in Physic be excluded from practice, the which be notGraduated.” In a later Statute of Henry VIII, (3. Hen. 8. c. 11.), also before the incorporation of this College of Physicians, and appointing the Bishop of London and the Dean of St. Pauls, with the assistance of four practitioners, a Medical examining Board, we find the following exemption of Graduates from examination, and acknowledgment of University privilege; “III. Provided always, that this Act, nor any thing therein contained, be prejudicial to the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge, or either of them, or to any Privileges granted to them.” The Charter of the College granted by Henry VIII, after the usual tirade against quacks, ordains vaguely, that the community of physicians of this metropolis shall meet annually to elect from their community a President; that they shall meet to frame rules, to direct and govern the said community within seven miles around this city; that no one shall practise in that circuit unless admitted by the President and community, (nisi ad hoc per dictum praesidentem et communitatem, seu successores eorum, qui pro tempore fuerint, admissus sit per ejusdem praesidentis et collegii literas, &c.); but of the mode of admission there is no hint, and much less of any authority to examine University Graduates, which is strictly prohibited by all the subsequent Statutes which confirm this Charter. The President and community are annually to elect from their own Body four supervisors, to form a kind of Council, for the regulation of the general affairs of the community, and of foreigners practising the same profession; and for the examination and testing of all kinds of drugs administered for the cure of disease. Then follow the usual exemptions from serving as watch and ward. So that the privileges expressed in this Charter are identical, in almost every point, with those granted to the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh more than a century and a half later. “The Charter and Statute of Henry VIII,” (say Dr. Paris, and Mr. Fonblanque, barrister at law), “is still the subsisting ground of the rights, privileges, and powers of the Corporation.” (Med. Juris. I. 15). But even this Charter was not legal, nor acted upon by the College as legal, till it wassubsequently confirmed by the Legislature. And “whatever might be the notion in former times, it is now most certain, that the Corporations of the Universities are Lay-Corporations; and that the Crown cannot take away from them any rights that have been formerly subsisting in them under old Charters or prescriptive usage.” (Id. ib.). The concluding clause of the same Statute, granting and confirming this Charter, runs thus:“That no person from henceforth be suffered to exercise or practise Physic through England until such time as he be examined at London, by the said President and three of the said elects; and to have from the said President or elects Letters testimonials of their approving and examination, except he be aGraduate of Oxford or Cambridge, which hath accomplished all things for his Form, without any Grace.” And this clause exempting physicians or the Graduates of this realm, as it then existed, from re-examination, is again confirmed by the subsequent Statute of Queen Mary, (1 Mary. c. 9). Instead of being left to confirmatory Statutes as is here done in the London College, this prohibition from insulting Graduates, is incorporated as we have seen above, in the clauses of the Charter itself, granted to the College at Edinburgh, which has precluded the base and arrogant use made of this omission by the London College of Physicians. He who asserts, therefore, that any clause in the Charter, granted to this College, either implies or refers to any power of encroaching on the right of examining and licensing Graduates, previously conceded by Parliament to the Chartered Universities, or of insulting them by a re-examination of their Graduates, is guilty either of a mistake or of a mis-statement. And no subsequent statutes emanating from the Crown, and ratified by the Legislature, either abrogate this privilege from the Universities, or confer it upon the College, (which would be equivalent to repealing the privilege of Universities.) The opinion given by the seven Judges, in favour of the College, on this subject in 1607, is entirely founded on their mistaking admission and examination as equivalent terms, and is distinctly at variance with every statute to which they refer, and on which they affect to found their judgment. The various statutes, indeed, are so intelligible and consistent on this fundamental point, that we are at a loss whether to admire more the duplicity of the questions proposed to the Judges on that occasion, by the College, especially of question fourth, or the dictatorial ignorance of their replies. This conduct of the College was equalled only by their imprisonment, three years afterwards, of Dr. Bonham, a Graduate of Cambridge, practising in London, who resisted their insolent attempt to disgrace his University, and who subsequently prosecuted the College, successfully, for false imprisonment. The term Licentiate, as I have mentioned above, does not belong to the Charter or Statutes of the College of Physicians, and was proposed at a late period, as an epithet of reproach, for persons found unqualified to practise as Physicians, but able to officiate as dentists, aurists, oculists, phlebotomists, &c.; the name of the miscreant who subsequently extended this opprobious epithet, to qualified practitioners and Graduates of Universities is unknown to me; time has, perhaps, too charitably veiled it from merited infamy, by wiping it from its records. The term Licentiate, at Edinburgh, is applied to Physicians in a state of transition, or probation, commonly of twelve months’ duration, between the period of his being proposed to the College, and that of his final admission to the Fellowship. There are thus no permanent Licentiates in that body—nor is there any insult in the use of the expression; and its upright conduct in this respect, while it typifies the distinct intention of the Charter of the London College, is a libel on the base proceedings of the latter College, where the great body of the members are arbitrarily robbed of their just and obvious right to the Fellowship. Oxford and Cambridge being the only English Universities, the Statutes of Henry VIII. strictly prohibited the London College from examining the Graduates of these Universities on their admission into the community of its Fellows : in the same manner as the Scotch College of Physicians is prevented by its Charter, from insulting the Diplomatists of the Universities of that country, and by the subsequent Union of the two countries under the same crown, there is a Community of Rights. The whole subsequent history of the London College, as indicated by its successive Statutes, its ever-varying, and timeserving By-laws, and its continual litigations with the members of its own body, is that of the most selfish and illiberal policy, and unworthy, though successful intrigue, where not one ray of conciliatory or generous feeling is ever to be detected.
  Does the history of Medicine present a more pitiful spectacle than the efforts made by this College, to injure such men as Dr. Wells, Dr. Armstrong, Dr. Wright, Dr. Stanger, Dr. Harrison, the illustrious Dr. Good, and others, alike esteemed for their private virtues and their professional eminence. The College of Physicians of London, drove Dr. Burgess from this metropolis, to seek practice in the country, in a manner revolting to every feeling of justice and humanity, merely because he had once been in Holy Orders; and this, although Linacre and Chambre, the two founders of the College, had themselves been in Holy Orders. If this College has never been respected by the respectful members of our respectable profession, it is because it has never sought, by a single generous or virtuous act, to merit the respect of honest men. The object of this College, as indicated by its Charter and its earliest Statutes, being merely judiciary, and relating to the quality of drugs, and the authenticity of diplomas, it could have no honour to bestow with its places, whatever emoluments might accompany their possession. But had it even possessed a scientific character, which it has vainly struggled to assume, where honour might have accompanied its elections, every trace of such accompaniment to its distinctions, must long since have been effaced by a systematic career of unprofessional usurpation and intrigue, alike revolting to every honourable feeling, and without a parallel in the history of Medical Institutions. Even to its recent invitations to Dr. Hall, Dr. Thomson and some other eminent Physicians, to accept the Fellowship ; and the use now made of the talents and learning of Dr. Hall, which under other circumstances might have admitted of a liberal interpretation ; the profession cannot now, for a moment, concede the merit of having originated from a virtuous or even a laudable motive; and must rather view these shallow subterfuges with pity and disdain. But the humiliation, the most deplorable, and the spot the most indelible on the spotted history of this illiberal Corporate Institution, is the disdainful rejection of its Fellowship by several Physicians the most eminent of our country or of any other, when offered for their acceptance. Dr. Arnott, not less illustrious as a philosopher, than distinguishd as a skilful and learned physician; Sir James Clark, Senator of the University of London and Physician to the Queen of England, and other ornaments of our profession, have recently declined to accept the proferred Fellowship. of the College of Physicians of London. And among other reasons for their declining such well-meant compliments, I may add, that the simple inspection of the Statutes, must long since have shown these eminent physicians, that by their admission as Licentiates, they are already as much Fellows of the College as the President himself. “By a recent return to Parliament,” says our distinguished President, “the whole number of the Fellows was one hundred and thirteen, of whom sixty reside in London, while the Licentiates amount to two hundred and seventy-four, of whom one hundred and forty-two are resident in the Metropolis,” (Dr. Webster’s Address, &c., 1837, p. 15.) And thus more than two thirds of the Physicians of this metropolis, and these the most distinguished for learning and skill, are at present arbitrarily excluded from their Chartered rights to the Fellowship of this College, by the most iniquitous system of By-laws which has ever disgraced a Corporate Body. In the late interview of our Deputation, with the College of Physicians, I directed attention to the very just and temperate complaints, urged by the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, regarding the inconvenience arising from the limited local privileges at present granted by Medical Corporations; and you were witnesses of the kind of tact, by which that politic Body has attempted to ward off similar complaints, for the last hundred and sixty years. We were assured that great measures of reform were in progress in that College, and that many resolutions calculated to remove these and other grievances had passed the College, and were about to be submitted to the Legislature. But has any thing been effected, except the granting of permission to the Licentiates, to subscribe for the partial use of their own Library, in order, if possible, to defer the period of its sale as bankrupt stock 2 And who could expect more from a Body, which well knew that precisely the same circumstances and the same grounds of complaint, had existed between the two Colleges of Physicians, for a hundred and sixty years ? Incapable of contributing to the advancement of any part of Medical Science, or of venturing into any honourable competition with the attainments of the Licentiates, yet anxious to make it believed that they have some claim to superiority over the latter, the petty expedients to which the Fellows of this College have been compelled to resort, to keep up a forced and false appearance, have made them the derision of the profession, and their Hall a kind of puppet-show, in which the more learned of their own Body are ashamed to be seen. But perhaps the most ludicrous act in the history of this fallen College, was their recent scheme of replenishing their exhausted funds, by advertising their willingness to make Physicians and to sell Diplomas in Medicine. And there can be little doubt, from the whole tenour of their past career, that had any customer presented himself, they would have perpetrated this outrage, to the further degradation of our unfortunate profession. After being supplanted by the wily Apothecaries in all that is lucrative or desirable in such Corporations, had this last effort of our empoverished and expiring College, to supplant the Universities, proved successful, it would have completed the ruin of our profession, by the promiscuous and indiscriminate admission of “weavers, women, artificers, Smiths,” and every quack who could have afforded to buy their cheap diplomas. Their recent proposal to intermeddle with the examinations of the candidates for the Degree of M.D. at the University of London, where the College now eagerly seek to admit into their body, Mahometans, Jews, Catholics, and all other forms of dissenters, shows the convenient pliability of their high moral and high church feeling. And the ready reception of this officious partner by the University, is conduct quite worthy of such corporate cliques. It would be no unprofitable reform, for a Parliamentary Commission to require this proteus like College, after all its metamorphoses, to return once more to the primitive simple privileges of its Charter and Statutes.
  INJURIES OF OUR CHARTERED MONOPOLIES.
  Although Charters are ostensibly granted for the public good, and the special benefit of the limited communities to which they relate, yet they are always the productions of small interested cliques. They are carefully worded to secure the private advantage of the soliciting parties, and cautiously expressed to conceal their real purpose from the Crown which is to confer them, and from the Legislature which is to confirm them by Acts of Parliament. The subsequent Statutes in favour of such Chartered Bodies, have always the same selfish origin and selfish purpose, and there are never wanting friends in office, or ignorant legislators, to assist in passing any proposition into law. The vagueness of Charters and Statutes gives scope for the development of vice in the machination of By-laws, which are generally too infamous to meet the public eye. The injury produced by most Charters, is caused by their monopolizing rights, checking competition, retarding, and impeding, and preventing improvements; and, by their protection, encouraging neglect and abuse, even when they are granted to communities, and administered by responsible Councils, which generally merge into arbitrary, irresponsible and self-electing juntos, by the supineness of their constituents. But of all the pests inflicted on civil society by an ignorant or partial Legislature, the worst are those Charters which confer irresponsible and despotic power, and where self-interest notoriously prompts to their abuse, and such are those of the Colleges of Surgeons and Apothecaries, and such has gradually become that of the London College of Physicians. The ignorance and supineness of our Legislature, as to everything connected with Medical affairs; the total want of representatives of our profession in the Government of the State, where the Church, the Law, the Army, the Navy, and Commerce are amply represented; and the despotic powers granted to our irresponsible Corporations, have rendered the Medical community of England, not only destitute of all redress or appeal against arbitrary oppression, but more disunited, disaffected, and degraded, than the subjects of Eastern despots, and more in need of a Bill of Emancipation than ever were the African slaves. The irresponsible members of the self-elected juntos, acting collectively in the secrecy and disguise of committees, clubs and councils, are guilty of acts, as every one knows, which they would not dare to perpetrate on their individual responsibility; and thus they have unblushingly, but notoriously sunk the standard of Medical education and attainments in our country, they have dismembered and disaffected the profession, they have made its contentions a proverb of ridicule, and ruined its respectability. They have obstructed every advancement, especially in such departments as depended more immediately on their influence for support; every improvement introduced has been made, not by their aid, but always in despite of their opposition; they have debased the generous practitioner of Medicine, from a benevolent and charitable philanthropist, to an arrogant, contentious, illiberal, avaricious and selfish misanthrope. Our talented and accomplished Philarchus, now stricken in years, satiated with the vanities of office, disappointed in the object of his ambition, supplanted in Royal favour, and fatigued with the toils of a long and active professional life, is made the tool and the puppet of a worthless, mindless, selfish party. With discernment to perceive the interested motives of his minions, with taste to despise their base tergiversation, and with sagacity to detect their ignorant pretentions, he discovers at the term of his existence, that the talents, the learning, the generous impulse of earlier years, have been entirely lost, by misdirection towards frivolous and worthless pursuits. With sensibility to feel, and judgment to appreciate the disregard and contempt of upright and honourable men, he finds, too late, that where no honour is obtainable in acquiring pre-eminence, there is neither glory, nor pleasure, nor merit in preserving it; that to countenance and prop the false pretensions of a worthless Corporation, was incompatible with true greatness; and that all his vain efforts and zeal for the petty concerns of his College, have served but to degrade and ruin his profession. Conscious that his ephemeral literary effusions, and trashy compilations for momentary effect and applause, were neither honest in purpose, nor honourable in execution, the names of Hippocrates, Galen, Celsus, Sydenham, Boerhaave, Heberden, the boast of his earlier years, are now painful momentos of a life mis-spent in the fascinating frivolities of a College, which seems to be the grave of intellect, as it is notoriously of justice and horfour. Never having risen, as a public man, to the conception of one great, generous or disinterested thought, or to the achievement of a single act honourable, liberal or praiseworthy, he discovers that in seeking to luxuriate on the false adulation of flattering expectants, in disregarding the sentiments, and opinions, and interests, of his professional community, and in exulting over their just complaints, he has alike forfeited their esteem, and jumped all claim to the respect of posteritythat he has played a successful game, but where the falsity of the dice has been detected and exposed. Seeing only interminable dissensions from his selfish policy, and the threatening inroads of liberal sentiment, he is tardily apprized, that his time, talents, and learning, long devoted to the support of Corporate abuses, have been worse than wasted on a barren soil, and have produced only rancorous weeds and poisonous shoots, whose baneful influence now recoils upon his own Body, and threatens its existence. Too weak to advance, too proud to retreat, distinguishing virtue from vice, but unable to yield to the pleasure of the former or to regard the sting of the latter, he feels the curse of pre-eminence in a bad cause, and his vacillating pace, his empty displays, and ludicrous shifts to preserve exterior show, and conceal internal degradation and decline, excite only pity and derision. Instead of presiding over a great, a liberal, and learned Society, once anticipated in his youthful dreams, this type of the influence of existing Medical Corporations is now mortified with the humiliating conviction that his earthly career has been wasted on the petty concerns of a despised Company, whose boast and object have ever been, to depreciate learning, to crush science, to stifle every liberal and generous sentiment, and to encourage avarice, disaffection, bigotry, intolerance, and every vice that can degrade the human character. Cato, in his fallen greatness, but without the sympathy claimed for the Roman Stoic ; Leonidas, in his stubbornness, but without the virtuous cause of the Lacedemonian ; the proud Philarchus dies, the puppet and the jest of a worthless, weaverexamining, drug-testing Corporation.
  INCORPORATION OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION.
  If the principles of Medical Government laid down at the commencement of this Oration be correct, the most satisfactory reform is unfortunately the least congenial to the spirit of British Legislation, that of adopting the profession as a part of the State, as in France, or as our Army and Navy; and placing its affairs under a distinct Minister of the Crown, like the Secretary for the Home Department. The second best would be the registration and Incorporation of the entire Medical community as one great body politic, with power delegated from the State to administer its own affairs, according to the reasonable interpretation of its Charter, a power which might become or appear formidable to an imbecile Legislature. The next approach towards the worst would be the Incorporation of each of the three existing great divisions of the profession, Apothecaries, Surgeons, and Physicians, with representative governments, throughout the extent of the realm. The next approach towards the present existing chaos would be a similar Incorporation and representative government of each of the three grades, in each of the three parts of the realm. But the last of all conceivable forms which the imbecility of human intellect could devise, is that which now disgraces British Legislation in the eyes of all civilized Europe. As the present state of the Medical Corporations of England is admitted by all to be far from creditable to our learned profession, and as reform is obviously incompatible with destruction, in seeking to reform these venerable institutions, we desire to render them more worthy of being handed down to posterity, as instruments capable of being eminently useful in the advancement of knowledge. All who are familiar with the popular constitution, the popular elections, the representative government, the responsible Councils, the entire satisfactory working, and the great public utility, of the Royal, the Geological, the Linnean, and other scientific Societies throughout therealm, must deeply regret that a form and system so congenial to the high character of the Medical profession, had not been early adopted in our Corporate Institutions, rather than the close, selfish and unscientific constitution, which has necessarily rendered them sounpopular and offensive, with the great body of the Medical community. In these learned Societies, although the Councils take the trouble to form and propose the By-laws, they are confirmed by the community of the Members before their ultimate adoption, and both Council and President are annually elected or re-elected through the medium of printed lists, and by ballot, by the great body of the Members. By the present Constitution and objects of our Medical Corporations, there can neither be honour in belonging to them, nor in attaining their highest places; their objects are limited by Charter to the selling of their local privileges, and their elections take place without the participation of the community of the Members, which alone could render them honourable. In some of the Corporations, as in the Colleges of Physicians, the small traffic in Diplomas is scarcely worth possessing; but it would be unjust to remove that little, without securing a distinct equivalent from the fund of the General Governing Board of our Incorporated Profession, to which all the detached privileges of the several isolated Corporations ought to be transferred, or directly from the public Treasury, from which at present are derived the scanty pittances to Universities, Royal Societies, and some other Institutions. The new and improved condition of our Medical Corporations, as scientific assemblies, would also demand and merit such Parliamentary aid. If, instead of the present numerous detached, learned societies, devoted to every separate branch of the Healing Art, in every city of the realm, in which the funds and talents of our professional brethren are frittered away, our great Colleges formed but one Royal Academy of Medicine and one Royal Academy of Surgery in each of the three divisions of the empire, devoted to the advancement of these great divisions of the Healing Art, aided by the public funds, with entirely popular constitutions, publishing Transactions, with Libraries and Museums, open to competition, bestowing honourable rewards on merit, is it likely that a single Member of the Medical Profession would not aspire to belong to such Colleges of learning; would not cheerfully submit to be governed by laws, which he himself contributed to form and could improve when found defective; would not willingly contribute his funds and talents, where merit was certain to be distinguished and rewarded, and where preferment was a voluntary tribute to honourable distinction ? No arbitrary grades, or oppressive By-laws, or ignominious ordeals, or degrading epithets, or disreputable intrigues, could here be tolerated or attempted; and indeed the calm pursuits which they would cherish and encourage, would greatly assuage the irritated feelings of our long insulted and dismembered profession. Is it likely that the Colleges, by such a change would become less prosperous in their funds, or less honourable and dignified in their character, less useful to the profession or to science, less respected and beloved by their members, or less beneficial to the community and to mankind? As the Councils of these learned Societies, Academies, or Colleges, would of course be representative Bodies, appointed by the suffrages of the registered members, either present or by lists transmitted to the Secretaries, they would be places of honour, but without labour and without emolument. Could the general community of the profession rely with more satisfaction, than on these honoured representative Bodies, over whom they retained an annual control, for the appointments to places of trust, of labour, and of emolument, in the great general Governing Faculty of our Incorporated profession ? The medical patronage of Hospitals and of all other Institutions for the sick, the regulation and the patronage of the Medical service of the Army and Navy, the Medical attendance on the sick poor, the examination and licencing of Medical Schools, the framing of Medical curricula, and the examination of candidates for Medical honours and privileges, would be among the duties of the salaried Boards or Governing Faculty, appointed by and from the popular and representative Councils. And they are duties of such magnitude and importance to the health of the general community of the realm, that the appointments relating to them, and their entire proceedings, ought perhaps to be ratified and confirmed by the Secretary of State; and all By-laws respecting the finances and the auditing of accounts might, perhaps, be submitted to the Commissioners of the Treasury. As the great Boards for the Army, the Navy, the India service, and other public services, are single and central, I do not perceive much difficulty or inconvenience to arise from the general concerns of the Medical profession being also managed by a single Metropolitan Board. There are six Colleges in different parts of France, but their affairs are regulated with uniformity and harmony, by the single central University of Paris, of which they are parts. The census and registration of the profession, Vote by Ballot, Annual Elections, ballots by authenticated lists, transmitted to the secretaries, uniformity of education, rank, title, and privilege, a high standard of qualification, honorary titles without privileges from Universities; the privilege of practice to be purchased from the Central Board, or its deputies, the sale of the privilege to be accompanied with examinations, except of Graduates of Chartered Universities recognised by the Board, being of course parts of such a constitution of the profession. The idea which has been suggested, that the present vested rights of the members of our Corporations might be an impediment to the adoption of any plan of improvement, even though acknowledged to be beneficial to the profession and to the public, is a libel not only on our professional brethren, but on the character of honest men, more especially as there can be no honour in belonging to them in their present form, and they are rather held in detestation by the great mass of the Medical community. Instead of such a single central Board, authorized by Government for the entire regulation of Medical affairs, as exists in most States of Europe; we have at present totally independent Medical examinations instituted, and totally independent Medical licences granted, by the University of Edinburgh, and the Royal College of Surgeons, of Edinburgh, the University of Glasgow, and the Faculty of Physic, and Surgery of Glasgow ; the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, and the University of Aberdeen; the University of Dublin, the University of Durham, and the University of Saint Andrews; The Army Medical Board, and the Navy Medical Board; The Dublin Apothecaries' Company, the Dublin College of Surgeons, and the College of Surgeons in London; the London Apothecaries’ Company, the College of Physicians of Dublin, and the University of London, the University of Cambridge, the University of Oxford, and the London College of Physicians—an absurdity of Legislation unparalleled in the history of any civilized country; the most ruinous to the best interests of the community, and the most injurious which the human imagination could devise, to the respectability and usefulness of the Medical Profession in England.
CASE, IN ILLUSTRATION OF EXISTING MEDICAL LAW.
  The following case, one of many similar, may serve to illustrate the necessary working of the present law of Medical practice, in reference to one class of practitioners. He who has now the honour of addressing you, after his general and professional studies at the High School, the University, and the private medical and general Schools of Edinburgh, extending over a period of twelve years, six being devoted to general, and six to general and professional studies combined, appeared before the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh on the 3rd of May 1814; and after submitting to examination in Anatomy, Surgery and Pharmacy, he received their Diploma as Surgeon, flattering him with the belief of being eminently quali-fied to practise the art of Surgery, (ad artem Chirurgicam evercendam quammaxime paratus.) This Diploma qualifies in Scotland, (where there is no Apothecaries’ Company) to practise both as Surgeon and Apothecary. It was and is usual with practitioners at Edinburgh, to be provided with the diplomas both of Surgeon and Physician, although not intending to practise both departments: the medical studies there, being thus practically conducted on the desirable principle of One Medical Faculty, although the examinations and diplomas are framed on the multipartite system. After the usual frequent written and oral examinations, therefore, conducted entirely in Latin, before the Medical Faculty of the University of Edinburgh, and after publishing and defending, in Latin, his Inaugural Dissertation, he obtained the Diploma of M.D. of that University, on the 24th of June, 1814. This document was still more promising and liberal than the former, and conceded to him the most ample power of cultiva-ting, teaching and practising Medicine everywhere, (amplissimam potestatem Medicinamubique gentium legendi, docendi et faciendi). Having discharged the duties of President of the Royal Medical Society of Edinburgh for twelve months, he started for the continent, and studied from 1815 to 1820 in Germany, Italy, and France. He commenced private practice as a Physician at Edinburgh in 1820, was one of the founders of the present Medico-Chirurgical Society of that city, and a contributer to its Transactions, and began in 1824, to lecture publicly on Comparative Anatomy, the fond avocation of his leisure hours. After practising, on the authority of his diplomas, for five years, unmolested by, and without risk of molestation from Corporate Bodies, at Edinburgh, and desiring to confine himself to the practice of Medicine, and to be associated with the College of Physicians of that city, he presented his University Diploma, through the late Dr. Barclay, to that Body, as directed by their Charter; and after the usual fees, was licensed to practise, by that College, on the 28th of December, 1825. On the expiry of the usual period of probation, he was proposed for ballot by the President, Dr. Monro, and admitted a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, on the 6th of February, 1827. This title being unattended with any new professional privilege, is more of an honorary nature, like those he had previously acquired from the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and other Societies in Scotland; and indeed in a single line of the Certificate at present granted to the Fellows, that Royal College has the modesty twice to call itself a Society. On the opening of University College, London, he was appointed to the Chair of Comparative Anatomy (an unendowed Chair and an unprotected subject), the duties of which he commenced in 1828, and still continues to discharge. In 1836 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society of London; he has been more than twenty years a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London, and belongs to the Geological, the Zoological, and other Societies of this Metropolis; and in 1837 he was appointed Professor of Physiology in the Royal Institution of Great Britain, a triennial appointment now expired. He has contributed to various works, and published some, on Anatomical subjects, and has been elected Honorary Member of some twelve or more Societies and Institutions devoted to Science or to Medicine, at home and abroad. But although he has passed through every required ordeal, and defrayed every incidental expense, to arrive at all the successive grades of . Apothecary, Surgeon, Physician, Licentiate, and Fellow of a Royal College of Physicians of this realm; although incapable of receiving a higher grade, honour or title from Medical Corporations, and willing to pay for the new Licence in London, as by Charter ordained, or to incur whatever further expences his change of residence may have rendered him liable to ; and although the College of Physicians of London, since the union of Scotland and England under the same crown, has no legal right to examine the Graduates of any of the Chartered Universities of this realm; he has now been prevented for fourteen years, by the usurped authority, and the arbitrary and illegal By-laws of that College, from deriving the smallest emolument from the exercise of his profession—a profession for which he has ever cherished the profoundest respect, and which he once had the hope of becoming a humble means of advancing. He has declined to disgrace his Fellowship in the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, by submitting to an arbitrary, illegal and ignominious ordeal, and the certainty of insult, from the College of Physicians of London, in the mere hope of receiving from them the degrading rank, and the opprobrious title of a Licentiate of their Body—an epithet of reproach adopted by the London College, about the year 1555, for persons found incompetent to practise as physicians, but capable of serving as dentists, aurists, oculists, phlebotomists, &c. Indeed, as a gross violation of his legal right, as well as of justice, professional etiquette, and decent civility between kindred establishments in the same realm, though now a sufferer from fourteen years’ privation of every privilege and advantage of all his past professional life, solely by the usurped authority of the College of Physicians of London, he repels the proposition of such ignominious ordeal from them, with its merited contempt, and leaves the scrutiny and application of his case to you, and its judgment to impartial posterity.
