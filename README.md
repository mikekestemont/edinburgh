# "Edinburgh and the Hidden Roots of Darwinism: A Peek Behind a Veil of Anonymity"

*By Koen Tanghe (Ghent University) & Mike Kestemont (University of Antwerp)*

This repository contains the software, figures and data for the authorship verification experiment reported in the paper "Edinburgh and the Hidden Roots of Darwinism: A Peek Behind a Veil of Anonymity". Our verification method is available as a single-file Python script (Python +3.4) which has the following, basic dependencies (mostly part of the Anaconda distribution):

- numpy
- seaborn / matplotlib
- pandas
- scipy
- sklearn
- nltk
- (numba)

The verification procedure and hyperparametrization are decribed in the Supporting Information that comes with the paper and is conceptually identical to the second-order, imposters verification approach introduced and described in the following papers:

- Koppel M & Winter Y. Determining if two documents are written by the same author. *J Assoc Inf Sci Technol*, 2014;65(1), 178â€“187.
- Kestemont M, Stover J, Koppel M, Karsdorp K & Daelemans W. *Authenticating the writings of Julius Caesar*. Expert Syst Appl 2016;63(3), 86-96.
